       "   \"    “There's something dangerous about the boredom of teenage girls.” How can I describe this book? Well, if  Bunheads  had a manic, intense and obsessive older sister, then this would definitely be it.  Dare Me  is about teenage girls - and cheerleaders in particular - straddling the line between childhood and the big world of adults but it isn't a tale that conjures up the usual images that high school cheerleading brings with it. This is an intense book about obsession, sexuality and competition. I think back once again to  Bunheads  and how that tells of the dark realities of ballet dancing, it isn't a nice pretty world of tutus and female friendship - you have to be ridiculously self-disciplined and ferociously competitive. That's what these cheerleaders are like, no sitting around being bitchy and doing  Mean Girls  walks through the school, they work hard to perform the routines. I can see in some ways why this book has a low average rating. For one thing, this isn't a nice story, teen girls explore their own sexualities and the mention of underage sex may make some readers uncomfortable. Make no mistake, this may be a book about teenagers but it is very much an adult novel. And, for another thing, the girls develop an extremely unhealthy obsession with weight loss in order to keep trim for the routines; but, as much as I hate the idea of forcing your body into an unnaturally skinny shape, this is the harsh reality for many athletes and/or dancers: hard exercise and hard dieting.  The murder mystery in  Dare Me  is only a small part of the excitement, much more thrilling for me was the focus on teen girls and their obsession with a new leader - in this case, the cheerleading coach. The new coach is beautiful, charismatic and vicious, she challenges them to be better than they are and she eventually becomes the centre of their almost godlike worship. The narrator (Addy) pauses at one point to think back on the very first moment when the coach arrived: Did she look at us that first week and see past the glossed hair and the shiny legs, our glittered brow bones and girl bravado? See past all that to everything beneath, all our miseries, the way we all hated ourselves but much more everyone else? Could she see past all of that to something else, something quivering and real, something poised to be transformed, turned out, made? See that she could make us, stick her hands in our glitter-gritted insides and build us into magnificent teen gladiators? In my opinion, the writing was exactly that perfect magical blend of pretty without being purplish. Abbott doesn't overdo it, she waits for the right moment and then pulls out a little gem like the one above to make sure you're kept in the mood of the novel. I also think I found this novel at the perfect time, it seemed to catch my eye just when I'd been discussing the portrayal of cheerleaders in American movies and books after reading  Storm . Often, cheerleaders are there as male eye-candy or as the bitchy, popular girls to stand as a comparison against the girl next door-type we are supposed to root for. In the UK, not many high schools have cheerleading teams, so opinion of them doesn't tend to stem from high school cliques and my only contact with cheerleaders has been on professional, competing teams. I love the way  Dare Me  completely ignores the stereotype and takes us into a world where it isn't about boyfriends and popularity, it's about fierce competition. Here the cheerleaders are not the centre of popularity but outcasts, living in a sphere separate from the rest of high school reality. They live and breathe the competition. It's intense. It's obsessive. It's a little scary. Most girls have an intense friendship with another girl while growing up, the kind of relationship that comes only through the sharing of childhood secrets, first crushes and hidden fears, through sleepovers where neither of you sleep.  Dare Me  is about these friendships and it's also about the breakdown of them... I don't think it matters how many great friends you make afterwards, there's still always something a little sad about looking back on your first friendship and remembering how you grew apart. In short, I really really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to everyone who likes something a bit edgy and different.\",\n",
       "   \"Sad,ugly characters doing sad,ugly things to one another. This is supposed to be what is in the heart and mind of the all-American girl? I'm not buying that. This is how Addy sees herself: p. 258  You see these glitters and sparkledust and magicks? It's war paint, it's feathers and claws, it's blood sacrifice.   Who the heck is she at war with? Herself? Who are any of them at war with? Why are any of them so angry? If I am expected to care, then explain to me why they are this way. Otherwise don't waste my time. There is no character that you have hopes for or care for or even like, other than perhaps the victim, but even there, what that person was doing was wrong. Who in this whole book actually does right? None of these characters are even fully formed. There is reference made of Beth's issues, but never explained why she behaves as she does, nor why none of these girl's parents seem to give two hoots about their supposedly perfect daughters. The way the girls tear at one another, bully each other and these are supposed to be their friends? I just don't understand what the author was trying to say with this. And the big reveal(I don't mean the reveal of the death which you would think is the big reveal, but the actual big reveal) in the final pages? Yeah, saw that coming a mile away, wondered how long it would take to get there. Who cares? There are some big continuity problems that don't make sense. Coach has her hair in a bob, but then later, only a matter of weeks later, it is described in a ponytail and a French braid. So does she have long hair, long enough for a French braid or ponytail or is it a bob? At one time, Coach is speaking to the girls in the locker room and they begin to scream with joy, jumping on the bleachers. There aren't bleachers in locker rooms.  The worst one is p. 117:  Clattering the phone against the wall, she catapults it down the toilet.  Addy is there and witnesses this happening, the phone down the toilet. The book is told in first person from Addy's viewpoint. So, then why on page 121 does she say   . . . I can't get Beth to return my texts.  Yeah, that would be because her phone went down the toilet four pages ago which Addy witnessed. Stupid. On page 123 Beth asks for her phone back and Addy reminds her that it went down the toilet. So, then why was she texting her two pages ago when she  knows  Beth's phone went down the toilet? Makes absolutely no sense.  Additionally, the description of the victim/suicide, which Addy saw, says the weapon was lying under the leg, but later Addy reads that it was by the victim's head. p. 191 reading from the newspaper article:  Recoil will usually cause a handgun to land behind the body, the source noted, not next to the head where it was found.  Addy is trying hard to figure out what happened and she never thinks to herself that that isn't where the gun was, but was under the leg. She supposedly can't get the image out of her mind, but she doesn't think that this is wrong. So, I'm guessing it is an error on the part of the author. Since all of theses small details do seem to matter to the plot, that is really badly done. Also, what world do these people live in where the high school cheer coach, in her office, at the high school, smokes? And I mean smokes like a flipping chimney. You can't even smoke outside most schools around here, let alone  in the building.   And she gives the girls cigarettes and then serves them alcohol at her home, with no mention whatever that this isn't okay. There is tons of teen drinking, drugging, drinking and driving, drinking while driving, with no mention at all that anyone is at all aware that these things aren't right.  Parents seem to not exist in this world.  Bottom line. One word. Ugly.\",\n",
       "   \"I can't even go far enough in this book to find out the premise. I do not even care. This is god awful. This is the worst kind of writing ( edit:  FINE. THE WORST KIND  to me . I suppose you're  allowed  to like it). So many analogies that don't actually even MEAN ANYTHING. You can't just... say things... and call it writing.  wishbone arms?  What do you mean by that? What is that? So, what? They're... all bowed out? They're skinny? They're dried out like after it comes out of a turkey and sits for a while? They're IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIRD?  hair like a long taffy pull  - okay, so... it's sticky hair? It's wide at one end, and then at the other end it's all thinned out and white and stringy? YOU CAN'T JUST SAY WORDS THAT SOUND PRETTY AND  AUTHORY  AND CALL IT WRITING. THEY NEED TO MEAN ACTUAL THINGS. I CANNOT READ THIS BOOK, FOR THE WRITING IS SHIT AND TERRIBLE. ALSO?  pigeon toed like a dancer  PLEASE, SHOW ME A PIGEON TOED DANCER. SHOW ME ONE. WHERE IS YOUR EDITOR, MEGAN ABBOTT? SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF. NO. NO. NO. YOU ARE BAD. YOUR BOOK IS BAD. THIS IS ALL VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD. When you use words, you use them to mean things. They need to MEAN THINGS. You can't just use them because they SOUND NICE OR SMART OR ESPECIALLY WRITERLY. That's like using an apostrophe because it LOOKS BETTER THAT WAY.\",\n",
       "   \"Dare Me by Megan Abbott is a 2012 Picador Books publication.  After reading  “You Will Know Me” , I knew I wanted to read more Megan Abbott, and I had even picked this book to be the next in line- It just took me a few years to finally get around to it.   Much has changed since this book was published in 2012. I know it was only eight years ago, but while the 'mean girls' trend was successful, and still pops up in various forms of entertainment, its shock value had been greatly reduced.    Still, this book is one dark and twisted ride!  For those of us who lived outside of the exclusive world of cheerleading, it seemed almost like a secret society. The girls are always popular, always attractive. They are perky and enthusiastic, and of course they can perform all those death defying stunts.  Behind the scenes though, there are bruises and punishing workouts… and the threat that hangs over them- the possibility of severe injury.  Cheerleading is like an exclusive enclave, but there is more to it than cute outfits, and the entertaining acrobatics. There is a brutal physical toll- and those stunts can be incredibly dangerous.  But, just like anything else, there is always the possibility of a dark side lurking just beneath the surface.  This novel gives readers a front row seat for an inside peek into what goes on behind that carefully crafted façade in the highly competitive world of cheerleading.  The premise, at least in the beginning, isn't all that shocking, on the surface. We have Beth Cassidy the undisputed leader of the cheerleading squad and her best friend, Addy, cruising along unchallenged, while the other team members acquiesce to her demands and leadership, knowing their place- or else.  Then a new coach takes over and upends Beth's hierarchy….  Immediately it becomes clear that Coach French will require a lot more discipline from the girls, demanding they perform tricky stunts, and announcing there is no longer the need for a team captain. While Beth seemingly takes all this in stride, one senses Beth is biding her time, waiting to pounce, to take her revenge. Coach French will pay a price for her demands and Beth expects Addy to fall in line with her, as usual.  However, Addy is a little bit in awe of Coach French, who inspires her try harder, to question her friendship with Beth. As a result, she soon finds herself caught between loyalty to Beth and her respect for Coach French… Until…  The new coach, who happens to be married, is found in a compromising position with another man. When her new lover allegedly commits suicide, Abby finds herself pulled deeper into the Coach's web as the police begin to question the cause of death. As damning evidence mounts, Abby begins to suspect several people in her inner circle of foul play…  This is a fiendishly entertaining, very clever, and uncomfortably realistic novel. The dangerous machinations and power struggles between these teenage girls almost eclipse the murder mystery and is a constant diversion, blinding you to even more sinister developments. By the end of the book I was on the edge of my seat!  Overall, this is a compelling drama, a taut cat and mouse guessing game, that is highly disturbing and deliciously macabre!!  4 stars\",\n",
       "   \"Trigger Warnings: suicide, bulimia, anorexia, alcohol.   I've been wanting to address this one for a while. [disclaimer: I DNF'd the book after Chapter Nine and have only seen a few clips of the TV show on YouTube. So my review is only based on the little bits that I have seen/read/heard.] I really wanted to like this one. I found out about this because I wanted to watch the TV show (the actual TV show, not clips on the Internet) and learned that it was based on a book. So I decided to read the book instead, since I figured that would give me enough of the aesthetic that I was interested in. Also because the show is R-rated and my mom would never let me watch it. And anyway it was cancelled. No. Don't do that to yourself. The first thing that stuck out to me was  the writing . At first, reading through the first two chapters online, I liked the prose and the lyrical feel to the words. I liked the aesthetic it created; the dark glitter and the blood, sweat and tears. And then I started listening to the audiobook, because Libby doesn't have the actual eBook, and it all went downhill from there. There wasn't actually anything wrong with the audiobook, but I just...don't vibe with audio. Even if it's a good reading. I think when I heard someone narrating out loud instead of reading the words for myself, I could just hear the phrases that stuck out. The inner monologues didn't sound like inner monologues because someone was saying them out loud with this tone that I wouldn't have “heard” if I was reading the book. And then of course there was the actual writing style. A few examples: I couldn't find the quote, but I do remember the exact words. “Hair like a long taffy pull.” This, by the way, is what a taffy pull looks like: Have you ever seen hair like that? Because I haven't except for on those fake-ass plastic dolls. And to make things worse, apparently there are different kinds of taffy and one kind is soft and the other kind is hard. And neither of them look like hair. I just...don't get it. Also, these are pieces of candy. But they're also supposed to be long? Because they look like hair? And then another terrible phrase: “...wishbone arms.” Wishbone arms???? Like...this thing??   Are her arms...like really weirdly bent or something? Are they skinny? Are they smaller than my hands? Are they easily broken? I'm genuinely confused. What kind of arms are those? What are these metaphors? “...pigeon-toed like a dancer.” Pigeon-toed? Are her feet turned in? That's what pigeon-toed means. However, as I can speak from experience, dancers walk with their toes pointed out. Or on their toes. Not with a mobile condition. Not like birds. Sure, there are a few awesome quotes and dramatic monologues in the book, but I can't get past these phrases. Especially when they're used to describe body parts. I don't like body part metaphors. They're uncomfortable and awkward and generally very strange and inaccurate. I just don't get it. You can use much more accurate descriptors and still sound lyrical. Making stupid comparisons that obviously make no sense is just...useless. It's not a qualification for authors to have to make idiotic similes and metaphors. What do these people look like, Bratz dolls? “Ages fourteen to eighteen, a girl needs something to kill all that time, that endless itchy waiting, every hour, every day for something — anything — to begin.” ...itchy waiting? Itchy??? Waiting??? Itchy??? What does this mean? Someone please explain to me what an “endless itchy waiting” is. Is it impatience? Are teenage girls too impatient to grow up? Are we trying too hard to be more mature? Because if we are, it's not our fault for thinking we have to. “That's what people never understand: They see us hard little pretty things, brightly lacquered and sequin-studded, and they laugh, they mock, they arouse themselves. They miss everything. You see, these glitters and sparkle dusts and magicks? It's war paint, it's feather and claws, it's blood sacrifice.” I'm going to be honest, that quote there is good. It's amazing, actually. There are so many parts of the book (as far as I read it/listened to it) that could have been this good if they'd actually made sense. Take this quote for example: “My question is this: The New Coach. Did she look at us that first week and see past the glossed hair and shiny legs, our glittered brow bones and girl bravado? See past all that to everything beneath, all our miseries, the way we all hated ourselves but much more everyone else? Could she see past all of that to something else, something quivering and real, something poised to be transformed, turned out, made? See that she could make us, stick her hands in our glitter-gritted insides and build us into magnificent teen gladiators?” It sounds amazing. But it's also metaphorically inconsistent and kinda weird. The first part talks about how Coach French looks past their “glittered exteriors”. But then the last part talks about how she re-forms their “glitter-gritted insides”. How can you be glittered on the outside and have that as a shell, and then have glittery intestines? Are you glittery on the outside or did you swallow too much lipstick? I don't understand this. The girls are supposed to wear their glitter as an exterior and a mask, as said in the beginning. But then apparently their insides are hardened by glitter too? Okay, I'm done with the weird body part confusion. The  plot  was okay, but kind of pointless. It wasn't going anywhere. Addy, the narrator, is immediately taken by Coach French, while her best friend and top bitch Beth is instantly hostile. A small-town squad of cheerleaders who don't actually know how to cheer. The small town is ~shook~ when the new cheer coach arrives. And then there's a suicide.  I'm saving the part that makes me mad for last. I want to take apart the structure first. This was really stereotypical. The cheerleaders are catty, competitive bitches who own the boys of the school. They're blond white party girls who cheer because it's hot. The cheer squad is elite and exclusive and evil. I'd like to point out that the TV show at least included diversity. But apparently this cheer squad can't even cheer. I'm not an athlete and I probably have no room to talk about this, but this group of cheerleaders can't do a basket toss and can barely pull off a pyramid...which I kinda thought were standard cheer moves? It does make sense since they're from a small town with low standards. But of course,  everything  changes when the new coach comes. Suddenly, everyone wants the top spot and they all want to win Regionals and State. There was nothing unique about this except for the overblown drama, which of course happens to Addy and Beth because of course they're the top two cheerleaders. Can you say stereotype? Even that was okay for me. I was still interested. And then I kept going and I just...couldn't. [here comes my rant] The suicide and mental health representation. What the actual fuck? First issue: the suicide felt like it was thrown into the plot to add drama.  Coach French was cheating on her husband with an army sergeant who was an old friend of hers, because of course we needed more clichés. And then Sarge died. Because Coach French cut things off with him. Because she was cheating on her husband. Literally the only reason the suicide happened was because Coach French didn't want to divorce the husband that she hated. Gotta love that logic. This was just a way to make the book more ~interesting~ because oh no he couldn't be with the woman he loved who  lived in the same town as him  so he just shot himself. Moving on, Addy has to hide a bunch of shit from Beth because now the cops are suspicious about the suicide and there's more drama. No. Fuck you. Suicide is not a gimmick or just another plot device for more tension. It's a real problem that hurts millions of people. It's something that people of all ages, genders and races struggle with. It's not a little storyline for a love triangle. It's something that I have dealt with and seeing it airbrushed into this little drama moment is just...disgusting. “Love is a kind of killing, Addy,  she says.  Don't you know that?” More mental health bullshit: anorexia and bulimia.  Coach French tells a girl, without a qualm or hesitation, to “fix her body”. She pinches the girl's waist and says “fix it”. What the fuck? “All those posters and PSAs and health class presentations on body image and the way you can burst blood vessels in your face and rupture your esophagus if you can't stop ramming those sno balls down your throat every night, knowing they'll have to come back up again, you sad weak girl. Because of all this, Coach surely can't tell a girl, a sensitive, body-conscious teenage girl, to get rid of the tender little tuck around her waist, can she? She can. Coach can say anything. And there's Emily, keening over the toilet bowl after practice, begging me to kick her in the gut so she can expel the rest, all that cookie dough and cool ranch, the smell making me roil. Emily, a girl made entirely of donut sticks, cheese powder, and haribo. I kick, I do. She would do the same for me.” IT'S NOT A FUCKING FAVOR. DON'T MAKE IT INTO A GOOD THING. Bulimia is a serious problem that is not just a little trend that teenage girls pull off so they can look prettier. It's a mental health disorder that can seriously damage someone's body, and an authority figure  encouraging a girl  to force herself to throw up her food and go on a liquid diet just for a cheerleading competition is sick. It's not just this one girl. Almost all of the girls on the squad are pulled into this. They stop eating, exercise for hours, make themselves tiny. One of them is described as a “pale eyelash of a girl” (more body part metaphors!) which is… You know. Totally healthy. Absolutely healthy that she just threw up after eating half a protein bar. Totally fine that she just almost passed out because she didn't drink her lunch carrot juice. “So I start with the egg whites and the almonds and the spinach, like wilting lily pads between my teeth. It's so boring, like not eating at all because you don't feel the sweet grit on your tongue all day and night, singing on the edge of your teeth. But my body is tight-tight-tightening. Hard and smooth, like hers. Waist pared down to nothing, like hers.” When I read this book, I was in fact dealing with anorexia. And the way this idolized dieting, losing inches off my waist, eating nothing but “weight-loss” foods and spending hours working out...that was harmful. It put me in the wrong mindset.  This romanticized bulimia and anorexia, because it was just  so worth it  to have a tiny waist. So no, I didn't finish this book. I don't want to, either. The whole thing was just girl-on-girl hate, body dysmorphia, airbrushed mental disorders, and glorified self-harm. The plot had nothing in it, the characters were literal plastic dolls, and the content of this book was disgusting, triggering, and downright insensitive. I really wanted to like this book. I actually convinced myself that I did for a while. But now that my mental health has...changed, I can definitely tell that this book is not good. At all. It's too problematic and insensitive. I came in looking for a dark aesthetic thriller with good tension and compelling characters. What I got was romanticization of eating disorders and suicide. Stay away from this kind of content.\",\n",
       "   \"Beth and Addy have been the top dogs on the cheerleading squad for years. When a new coach comes in and upsets the apple cart, how will Beth react to her role being usurped? And what dark things are waiting in the wings for Coach French? Wow. I've said it before but Megan Abbott makes the politics of teenage girls look as brutal as the Game of Thrones. Dare Me is a look behind the curtain at what makes teenage girls tick, specifically the ones motivated to be cheerleaders. Eating disorders, cattiness, the whole nine yards. When the Coach arrives and usurps Beth's role in the squad, things quickly start falling apart. Beth goes on a calculated rampage, the Coach's unhappiness is exposed, and Addy is stuck trying to hold everything together. You wouldn't think a tale about cheerleaders would be this dark but the girls are like a pack of wolves, pouncing on any pack member that makes a misstep. Beth was pretty slick and would make a great femme fatale once she gets a few more years on her. Coach French seemed like she became a coach because it was the only part of her life she had control over. Addy's struggle between her loyalty to Beth and her new relationship with the coach kept the plot rocketing forward. There's a twist near the halfway point that sends the book veering into standard noir territory. While I was pretty sure who the culprit was, Megan had me off on tangents a few times. I had an inkling of how the book was going to end but that did little to lessen the impact. It still hit like a cheerleader's head on an unpadded gym floor. As of this writing, I've read five or six Megan Abbott books and this one was my favorite yet. Five out of five stars.\",\n",
       "   \"update: APPARENTLY THIS IS GETTING A TV SHOW BUT I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED??     “There's something dangerous about the boredom of teenage girls.”     This is... a weird book. And it's definitely going to be  polarizing.  But holy shit, for me, this book was    fantastic   . It's not necessarily a book you'll enjoy, but oh my god, does it stay with you - this book along with Abigail Haas'  Dangerous Girls  got me interested in the suspense genre. It has been over a year now since I read this book and it still haunts me.  Dare Me  is about obsession.  It's about dedication and coming-of-age in a brutal world. It's about power plays and hatred. It's about the drive for competition, and how boyfriends and dating play into that competition in the teen world.  It's about the twisted kind of love . The writing is gorgeous without being purple-prosey. All of this incorporates itself into a brilliantly suspenseful novel that is impossible to put down. I read this book in midwinter at Lake Tahoe, yet the atmosphere of this book drew me in so well that I was totally lost.  Megan Abbott's mood and tonal shifts are genuinely remarkable, keeping you on the edge of your seat.  I love mood books ; I love books that make me feel, even when I don't know what's happening. This book is confusing and screwed-up and flat-out weird, but it's utterly amazing. The ending is almost unclear - I don't think I liked it when I first read this. But in hindsight, I think  the ambiguous and odd ending worked perfectly . It's the reason this book still stands tall in my memories, and always will.  Beth and Addy are both deeply awful, and yet I sympathized with their  complex characters  completely - even when they're dislikable, they interest you, keep you reading. The relationship between Beth and Addy is deeply messed up by the forces of competition and codependency and yet they remain so interesting to read about.     We're all the same under our skin, aren't we? We're all wanting things we don't understand. Things we can't even name. The yearning so deep, like pinions over our hearts.     There's something I wanted to talk about in terms of queerness in this book. In  Dare Me , relationships between men and women are a weapon, used for power and for sex. The only relationships that do  not  revolve around sex are those between women: Addy and Coach, and Addy and Beth. Yet both of these relationships are influenced by attraction, from the one-sided attraction between Addy and Coach to the two-sided attraction between Addy and Beth. It is simply that these are the only relationships into which the characters pour real emotion and genuine love. This gets a high recommendation from me to anyone who enjoys suspense novels and ambiguity. Blog  |  Goodreads  |  Twitter  |  Instagram  |  Youtube\",\n",
       "   \"First Read: November 2016, Rating: 5/5 stars Second Read: April 2020, Rating: 4.5/5 stars Raw, gritty and completely unforgiving. Abbott exposes the teenage girl populace in a harsh and exposing light in this unputdownable dark contemporary! Best friends Beth Cassidy and Addy Hanlon are the Queen Bee and Lieutenant of their high-school. Their status as cheerleaders means no more to them than to ensure that all eyes are turned their way as they parade the hallways in packs of short skirts and flipping ponytails. That is, until a new coach arrives and is determined to make the cheer pack sleeker, slimmer and more daring. On their way to perfection, every flaw is uncovered, every trick perfected and not all friendships will last this test of endurance. Abbott is an absolute master at exposing the nuances of the politics that govern the lives of teenage girls. Her characters might not represent the norm, but they act as exaggerated spokespersons for what lies beneath the facade of bored indifference, perfectly glossed lips and exposed lengths of legs that categorize these girls. More fierce than war generals, more determined than Olympic athletes and more cut-throat than criminals, these girls maintain the facade of solidarity with simpering smiles whilst dually knifing each other in the back at every opportunity.  I flew through this book in less than a day and found absolutely every page compelling and enthralling. Abbott made her pack of glossy cheerleaders far more than their image and her quest for raw truth made their stories intrepid and valiant. I found no inherent good in the story and yet found myself rooting for each of them, despite their immoral, and often illegal, antics. This voyeuristic insight into the elite cheer pack made me dually want to relive my teenage years as one of their clique and glad that I stayed clear from this dog-eat-dog form of friendship. This tale proves that getting to the top of the pyramid isn't the hardest part, but staying there is. During my second reading I found this no less compelling but a little more removed from the teen, school drama.\",\n",
       "   \"3.75 Stars* (rounded up) Yowza! This is Mean Girls at its Very Best and when its Wicked, it's Totally Wicked. And when it's Trashy, it's Totally Trashy. And in those MOMENTS? It is HIGHLY ENTERTAINING. Dare Me by Megan Abbot is High School Cheerleaders' version of Mean Girls with a little mystery thrown in. It's entertaining and campy and it almost makes me want to be back in High School. To be teased mercilessly.  Not. . And I swear the book didn't inspire me to want to go out and buy pom poms either... (I'm serious...  Really! ). This is the story of cheerleaders and best friends, Addy Hanson and Beth Cassidy. Beth has always been the Captain, and Addy, her lieutenant. Together, they are fierce! Beth has always been as cold as ICE and no one crosses her and no one can get to her, no one except Addy. Then everything changes for Beth, as Addy begins looking up to the new Coach, Ms. Colette French, and not Beth. Tempers rise between everyone involved and the games begin (and I don't mean football games). To make matters worse, something goes awry for Addy and for Coach and its something bad with a capital B. Many secrets are kept and Beth is the middle of all of it and is loving every single second of it - because Beth is bad with a capital B, too. Dare Me is a wickedly entertaining and totally sophomoric novel that was enjoyable and very fast-paced. I listened to this audiobook and found the narrator to be superb. Megan Abbot did a splendid job of creating real characters whose pain I felt (and considering most of them were in High School and I am not), I thought that was a nice feat. If you are looking for an entertaining though somewhat campy YA novel, give this a go. ** I must provide a disclaimer however that my enjoyment of this novel (which includes incidents of teenage bullying) does not mean that I, in anyway way, condone that behavior.

       "   \"This book focused on cheerleading which reminds me of the cheerleading movie called Bring It On. At first the story is fast paced and then there were weird vibes with Addy and her thoughts/conversations on/with Beth, Sarge, Coach, and Casey. This story seems to be about friendship but somehow the relationship is tumultuous. I do like the puzzles Addy was to solve: the lies and the sprinkles of information from Matt. \\u2029This book started with a prologue told in the first person point of view following Addy, 16. It's 2am, someone asked Addy to come. Addy was reluctant when she looked at something on the floor. Then the story began 4 months ago as Addy got ready for cheerleading. At football season, the cheerleaders have a new coach, Coach French, 27. This coach is unlike any coach the girls had before. Addy is Beth's sidekick/lieutenant and Beth always do what pleases her. With Coach around, Beth has a competitor. The story is timeline by counting down to the final game where the cheerleaders will do their big stunt. Except around the final game, an arrest is made for someone's death. \\u2029Dare Me is cheerleading and mean girls who defy their parents and do underage drinking and drugs. I just have little tolerance for characters intentionally bringing trouble upon themselves or purposely do dumb things. Therefore, Beth is my least favorite character. At first I like Addy but later I don't because she's mean too. The Coach thinks their parents don't care for them but it's not true because Addy's dad cared when Addy said he waited up for her. Coach is no better complaining about how the girls' parents don't care and it's her job to care but she served them alcohol when they're together. The crime and suspense is good. I like not knowing who to trust and how little by little it all comes out. xoxo, Jasmine at  www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com  for more details  Many thanks to Little Brown for the opportunity to read and review.\",\n",
       "   \"Previously I'd read two Megan Abbott books,  The Song is You  and  Queenpin . Both were razor sharp noirs set in the past with cynical hustlers smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey and basically behaving like the type of people who belong in a black and white movie. This book is about cheerleaders in a modern high school. It's not as different as you'd like to think. Addy has long been the best friend and lieutenant to Beth, the captain of their cheerleading squad. Beth is smart but self centered with a mean streak and a knack for the complete social destruction of anyone who irritates her. When a new young coach inspires the squad and pushes them to new levels, a contest of wills between Beth and Coach ensues. When Addy begins to side with the Coach, Beth steps up her efforts to reclaim the top spot and tries to use a secret against Coach while Addy scrambles to try and limit the damage. When a tragedy occurs, Beth gleefully begins a campaign of psychological warfare against Addy to convince her that Coach isn't what she appears to be. Megan Abbott's writing continues to be among some of the best stuff I'm reading these days and she does some outstanding work in two areas in this book. First is the way that she puts the reader inside the head of Addy and makes even a bitter and grumpy middle aged man like myself understand and empathize with a teenage cheerleader.  Second is how she builds up the world of cheerleading with the constant practice of stunts that can cause serious injury if they go wrong. The work and pain these young women go through to excel at what they do seems as serious and intense as an NFL training camp.  I didn't enjoy this quite as much as her other two books, but it's still a four star read.\",\n",
       "   \"Dare Me is fun, y'all. A great escape. Indulgent. I am planning to watch the series now because I finished this juicy book last night. It's been called a cross between Heathers and Fight Club, and I can definitely see why. I was entertained, distracted from the world around me, and a bit wicked for enjoying this one so much?! I received a gifted copy. All opinions are my own. Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog:  www.jennifertarheelreader.com  and instagram:  www.instagram.com/tarheelreader  \",\n",
       "   \"I know absolutely nothing about teenage girls--something that, sadly, was also true back when I was a teenage boy. Megan Abbott, on the other hand, either has a very good memory or has done prodigious research into the subject. Actually, I suspect that it's a combination of both, and the result is her excellent new novel,  Dare Me .  The book is a meditation on the nature of friendship, love, competition, betrayal and young girls coming of age, set in the world of cheerleading. In it, Abbott exposes the dark underside of the cheerleaders' world and describes a culture that would have me quaking in my boots if I had a teenage daughter. Beth Cassidy and Addy Hanlon have been best friends since childhood. Beth is the tough-as-nails, natural born leader and Addy is her able lieutenant. They are both tanned and beautiful and are the stars of their high school's cheerleader squad.  Until now, this has required little more effort than the occasional lackadaisical practice, maintaining their hairdos and shaking their assets come game time. But suddenly there's a new sheriff in town or, actually, a new coach who takes cheerleading seriously as an athletic competition. The coach, Colette French, is not that much older than the girls themselves, but she drills them like Marines and whips their bodies and their attitudes into shape. Before long, they're doing routines they never would have dreamed of before. Most of the girls, Addy included, buy into the program enthusiastically. But Beth is not happy. Coach or no coach, she has always been the team's natural leader, and she detests even the suggestion that she might be eclipsed by the new coach. She is particularly unhappy about the fact that in her view, Addy has turned against her by aligning herself with the coach, and Beth is not a girl who will take this lying down. The coach is a woman with troubles of her own, which soon bubble to the surface with dire consequences for the young charges she has drawn into her orbit. To say anymore would probably be to say too much. Suffice it to say that these characters are fully drawn, eminently believable, and may of them are scary as hell. But watching the story unfold is mesmerizing--you cannot turn away. Megan Abbott has delivered another very good book that will linger a long time in the reader's memory.\",\n",
       "   \"There's something dangerous about the boredom of teenage girls. The thought of getting older is something that scares the bejesus out of me every day I look in the mirror and see a new gray hair or small wrinkle, but there is noooooo amount of money in the world that would make me want to be a teenage girl in today's society. Girls have found all sorts of new ways to be vicious to one another, high schools have become war zones, and the pressure to be thin, beautiful, and perfect, has surpassed anything I could have imagined as a teenager.  Megan Abbott's novel isn't just about average  mean girls . DARE ME is set in the back-stabbing and competitive world of American high-school cheerleading...and believe me there are nooooo spirit fingers here... DARE ME is narrated by 16-year-old Adelaine (Addy)- who at the start of the story is best  frenemies  and lieutenant to Beth- the manipulative and emotionally abusive captain of their school's cheerleading squad- until the arrival of an attractive and exciting new coach- Colette French. As Beth starts losing control of Addy and the rest of her team- coach becomes  the enemy  who must be destroyed. This is NOT the Rah Rah cheerleading I remember from my high school, and DARE ME is NOT the YA reading I was doing in my teenage years. I am not a parent- if I was I would cringe a little if I saw this book on my teenager's night stand- but as an adult I loved it. It has been billed as Fight Club for girls...but it reminded me more of Heathers meets Bring It On.  Mystery, secrets, extreme paranoia, sex, loss of innocence, diet pill popping, smoothies and murder. Once you start reading, it is hard to put down.\",\n",
       "   \"Wow. This was just really, really bad. I knew 10 pages in, that this book, definately wasn't for me, but I hate not finishing a book, no matter how godawful it is {example: 50 Shades of  shite  Grey}. Yes the author throws in some typical high school speech {see beyotch etc.} to show the readers that she's down with the lingo, but the majority of the dialogue between the characters was ridiculous. People do not speak like that.  The suns down and the moons pretty,  she says, her voice hushed.  It's time to ramble.  <--- Just one inane description. Then there's the lust for Coach. Why these girls fawn over her was never justified in my eyes. She refused to divulge her private life, therefore she became a mysterious enigma? She told them to 'tighten up' their bodies, they fall down worshipping her. All except one - Beth - who sees right through her. Good woman Beth. Well, she's actually quite psychotic.  Basically that's it. Oh and a suicide thrown in for good measure. And a hint of pseudo lesbianism thrown about which doesn't even materialize into anything, but constantly lingers.  Unfortunately it just didn't do anything for me. \",\n",
       "   \"I've read gobs of creepy books and watched heaps of horror movies, but nothing can run a spike of scare through me quite like a gaggle of teen girls. You knew these things already, didn't you? Or at least suspected -- the vicious, petty jealousies, the unchecked hormones, the cutting intelligence harnessed to manipulate and intimidate, the capricious cruelty, the fathomless insecurities, the abiding self-loathing ... need I go on?  Teen girls are a tribe unto themselves, with their own language, dress code, rules of behavior, and very specific rites of passage. Every day is Lord of the Flies day for teen girls. They don't need no stinking island to channel their inner savage, alright? Stephen King knew this when he has Carrie White cornered and bleeding from her first menses in the girl's high school locker room while her classmates pelt her with sanitary napkins and tampons chanting:  Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!   In  Dare Me , Megan Abbott takes you  deep  into teen girl territory, so deep you will flinch, and grimace and squirm at all the things she's going to show you. It's a sordid voyeurism that will have you screaming for more. This isn't a darkly humorous satire a la  Mean Girls  or  Heathers . Not at all. This is a sober, penetrating look at the inner lives of a group of cheerleaders -- their insular, isolated existence as members of a tribe within a tribe. Their rituals include starvation diets and brute, physical demands requiring near constant pain and risk of serious injury.  Into a volatile balance of power comes new Head Coach Collette French. Loyalties shift, boundaries are tested, trusts will be broken and amidst all the angst and perpetual drama, a body will be discovered. For Ms. Abbott isn't just writing cheerleaders, she's writing  noir  cheerleaders, with a rich cast of characters each vying for the role of femme fatale.  This is a story icky in parts dealing as it does in burgeoning, pubescent sexuality, obsessions and desires. For all of that it is bloody  fascinating  featuring an engaging plot that Abbott has exquisitely paced. I read this in one sitting. I was violently pulled into this world and held captive the entire time. This isn't a happy story. You've been warned.   \",\n",
       "   \"I'm having a heck of a time trying to review this one! Megan Abbott's writing is brilliant, and she can get into the psyche of teenage girls like nothing I've ever read. While her writing is as amazing as ever here, the plot didn't thrill me. This story goes into the world of high school cheerleading, and holy shit was I ever surprised! This is not the cheerleading I know, where girls ruffle pom-poms and smile. No, this involves dare devil stunts where injuries can be fatal.  Abbott writes:   Now we are learning the pyramid isn't about girls climbing on top of one another and staying still. It's about breathing something to life. Together. Each of us a singular organ feeding the other organs, creating something larger. We are learning that our bodies are our own and they are the squads and that is all. We are learning that we are the only people in the world when we are on the floor. We will wear our smiles tight and meaningless, but inside, all we care for is stunt. Stunt is all.   She goes on to describe the relationships between the girls, and in particular the squad leader and her best friend, also on the squad. These relationships are all consuming, fierce, unnerving. The squad leader is the top of the food chain. She calls all the shots, who's in, who's out. She says jump and they ask off which bridge. I found this amazing, and how Abbott describes these relationships blew my socks off! Okay, now plot. Well, here we have a murder committed that may involve the coach. The squad leader and her best friend are at odds, jealousy is rampant between them as the best friend and coach get to close. While the writing nails the deep emotions between all three, I found the story a little far fetched. It did show me how boundaries get crossed between coaches and their  girls,  but I wasn't thrilled with how a murder became the driving force. I've always been one for great writing though, so while this may not be my favorite Abbott book, I'll be sure to read more of her!\",\n",
       "   \"This is my second Megan Abbott, and it won't be my last. There's something about her razor-sharp writing that is so damn compelling and interesting that goes well beyond the subject matter. I'll be honest. I don't care too much about cheerleaders and cheerleading, but when you mix a near Machiavellian cruelty to the scene, with all the world-weariness of 14 year old girls, and write the living fuck out of it, it becomes mesmerizing.  A lot of people say that Abbott writes Noir, and it is definitely her writing's strength. Sharp lines, stark definitions everywhere, and a deep undercurrent running through the tale. Was it suicide? Was it murder? How is Beth involved? Is the Coach guilty? It's all questions and blinders, and it never sinks into a normal murder mystery. Our narrator Addy so well-crafted that I doubt I'll ever forget her.  Everyone's complex. It's hard not to make a serious connection to Lolita, from the cover of the novel to the layers and layers of personality within Addy and all the versions of Beth and Coach French to which we are treated. It's a mystery. But it's also the heaviest novel about cheerleading I've ever read. Indeed, that I ever want to read. The competition is there, of course, but the way all these girls get prepared as if for war, punishing themselves far worse than they punish each other, is just as bad as any of the most intense sports-competition stories I've ever read/watched/or experienced. The microcosm is damn oppressive. It's easy to imagine transporting these girls to an upscale brothel in the 50's under the complex and caring touch of a well-meaning madam, or cutting off a tit to be that most excellent archer of Amazonian fame for the glory of Diana. *sigh* Disturbing. Glorious. The fact is, the writing is so damn good that I fell into the story despite myself. It's truly brilliant in that respect, but I still don't care for the actual subject. My Bad!\",\n",
       "   \"I wrote this review while playing Nancy Sinatra's  Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down).  There are reasons why that's appropriate, but that might delve into spoilerific territory, so I digress. Forewarning: this will be a long review, possibly one breaking the character limit. That might be surprising considering I'm giving this (close to) 5-stars. In the aftermath of reading this, I will definitely be reading more of Megan Abbott's work. No question. Short version of this review: I freaking loved this book. Problematic as all heck - I realize - but that was a ride I would want to ride again, over and over. Willingly.  The long version of this review gets a bit more complicated because I'll acknowledge this book has significant caveats and (notably) won't strike everyone the same way. It is entirely a love it or hate it read, and it's problematic to say the least (understatement). I understand why, and I'd understand anyone's hesitation to pick it up. I should also mention that while this features a teen protagonist, this is very much an adult book. (I definitely think there are teens who would appreciate this read for what it offers. Considering the content, though, it's a hard bargain. Discretion advised.)  I'd honestly say this is one to give a try at the very least because...dude. Let's have a conversation.  Dare Me  was yet another library recommended read that I randomly picked up in the context of recs made in the scheme of  Gone Girl.  As you guys know, I take comparison reads very lightly. More often than not, they're not always accurate and can set up unrealistic expectations. In the aftermath of reading this, I somewhat see why the rec came about.  For one, it's a very dark read - the tension in  Dare Me  is so thick wading through it, you find yourself lost in its pull of the trainwreck variety. I could not stop reading this book once I started. Even putting it down, I wanted to pick it back up again because I had no idea where the heck it was going. It has more than its fair share of twists and turns.  Another similarity: the characters are supremely unlikable.  I didn't like a single character in this book, not even the protagonist Addy (who arguably has some sympathetic qualities, she's quite the anti-hero). So you might wonder why I give close to five stars for a book that's essentially about a bunch of pretentious, self-absorbed teenage cheerleaders abusing Adderall and doing everything they can to maintain slim figures and championing unhealthy eating habits and eating disorder behavior?  Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for well-developed, unlikable characters playing head games with each other and exploiting/competing in positions of power, which is pretty much what happens in this book.   Almost to the point it could be Shakespearean. Think Othello being manipulated by Iago when it comes to O's relationship with Desdemona. Except this isn't a romance or really something that's heavily suggestive in that scheme. Not in the least (though you could fill a bucket with the sexual tension in this book).  Relationships are manipulated and manipulative. Every single character here has their own aims and desires and they'll do whatever they feel necessary to get what they want. Or protect whom they need to in some cases. I'm still shocked that this book pulled me in as much as it did. I had no idea what I was signing up for when I picked up this book and I ended up completely blindsided for the experience. The story on its surface seems like a stereotypical one: you have a cheerleading team that's led by a very strong social butterfly (Beth) for a team captain and her best friend (Addy). Addy is the narrator for this book, and by every measure of description - Addy and Beth's relationship is inseparable. Beth's the queen, Addy's her partner in crime. Their relationship is a formidable one and not necessarily challenged by their peers. At least until a new coach comes into town. The new coach is a young, seemingly powerful woman that gradually wins over the team's affections with her no-nonsense approach to the drills and performances of the team. But it's also her lax demeanor that draws the girls in and allows them to bond with her. Abbott's descriptions for the performances by the team unfolds like watching a dance - I loved the descriptions here, even if sometimes they seem a bit superfluous.  My enjoyment's probably heightened there because: 1. The descriptions seem so vivid that they're artistically drawn in the prose. 2. I'm a graduate in exercise science so the attention given to their bodies and movements really captivated me. I haven't seen that in a lot of texts like this and Abbott portrays it very well. 3. The portrayal syncs truthfully with the character voice, for better and worse. Addy's character matches her voice for depictions of events and performances in her witness - she's a spoiled teenage girl with a dark streak and surrounded by other characters who are just as flawed as she is. This is especially well noted in the audio reading of this book. Addy's reflections are indulging for senses and symbolic parallels, yet flawed at the same time. So it worked for me. The coach seems to win everyone over, except Beth. Beth hates the coach with a furious passion, one Addy can't quite put her finger on for certain measures. At first Addy thinks it's because Beth has lost her former power as the team's captain, but it becomes more as Beth's hatred becomes personal, borderline obsessive over the Coach's life and secrets that are kept between the girls. Then the unthinkable happens to someone in their circles, and it throws the coach and the girls into a tailspin. Addy finds herself front and center in the midst of a game of secrets, lies, and manipulations. She's a puppet trying to find out who's pulling her strings and why. I LOVED that aspect of it. The story unfolds like a whodunit mystery but at the same time a dark series of power struggles and sensual tension that builds with a swelling crest up until the  a-ha  moment comes about. I didn't know what route it would go until the last possible point, and it made sense as far as the lying and manipulations were concerned on behalf of multiple parties. Addy's relationship with the coach is palpable, and the Coach, while she seems admirable on the surface, ends up not being much more mature than the students she teaches as her flaws come to the forefront, and she has her own motivations to lie. I saw that as intentional and not a flaw of the text itself. Whether the Coach's motivations are to protect herself or others remains to be seen, and Addy's left to the task of uncovering that on her own. Of course, Addy's pretty much a pawn in some measures, because she's played multiple times between people. It's also revealed that Addy knows Beth is far more twisted for intentions than one would think, to a point that Beth has this hate/love game that she makes Abby play - one piece at a time.  While this read might seem cliche on the surface, it's really many layers of a drama built on top of an established stereotype, to be honest. It doesn't mince the fact that these characters are flawed, nor does it push the cast as worthy of emulation - rather stuck in their own delusions. Addy, Beth, and the rest of the crew are all flawed, and standing high on a precipice of denial, indulgence and power, with an event that rattles and threatens to break their foundation. (And I like the parallel that's drawn to the cheerleading routines with this aspect.) It's certainly seen (and felt) with respect to Addy's character, as she tries to navigate the confusion and conflict she feels over events even while she's a character with her own twisted justifications for things. She's also more than willing to hurt whom she has to in order to seek the answers she wants. And OMG, Beth. Can we talk about Beth? She's probably the character that's love to hate here. She's tugging strings and she doesn't care, but the text manages to give her human qualities in the scheme of things, even if you're not sure why she does the things she does up until a certain point, especially when Addy starts revealing things from their past that suggests her own callousness that could run parallel with Beth's manipulations. The two are really more similar than you'd think from the beginning of the work, and neither one of them are necessarily more  moral  than the other. It's just a matter of seeing why they act and react the way they do. Even then, there are points where it leaves you guessing because you're not exactly sure why their loyalties still lie to each other, but yet they're still willing to hurt and manipulate their close relationship. It's a power play, and the fact it's done by these teenage girls who have such social standing is scary enough to think about, especially when it comes to their coach and what they know and how they choose to dance with that information. There's some suspension of disbelief to be had, and I think Abbott works it well - but for some readers, that suspension may not be enough to drive some of the strong symbolic qualities and overarching themes this work has to offer. And that's a shame, because when it hits the ground running, it does remarkably well. I saw it, and I loved it.  The ending of the work is hit or miss for events. I thought it was a bit quick for the resolution and even then, there's not a fulfilling sense of vindication for the wrongs that are committed. Then again, I don't think it was meant to be that kind of story, as this cast of fools pretty much end up with a queen and you're watching how all of them collide and function in this bubble, along with the  why . In the end,  Dare Me  answers the question of how far its cast will go to be on top, or risk losing it all, even if it has deadly consequences. I thought the book was brilliant for what it chose to show, with some rough edges and suspensions to take into consideration. I would read this again, readily, for how dark, twisted, and vivid the presentation came across in Abbott's narrative. Overall score: 4.5/5 stars\",\n",
       "   \"Ugh. This one left me so frustrated.  The storyline centers around the struggles of a teenage cheerleader who gets sucked into the warped world of her adult coach's sordid love triangle, all while battling the usual teenage issues. The description on the back of the book is much better and sounded really promising, so I snatched this one up. First things first. I went into this with a critical eye because I was a competition cheerleader for years. When Abbott first describes the girls, she basically says they do nothing but shake their asses. Yet, magically, after a few weeks with Coach, they are an award-caliber team who can stunt on an expert level. Yeah, that doesn't happen. Second, the language just killed me. I work with teenagers all day, every day. The girls in this book do not sound like any teenagers I've ever encountered, unless they were teleported from some bizarre Clockwork Orange lingo land. Some of the random slang made me wonder if I was on drugs myself.  The characters started out decently, at least in concept, but I really had no connection to any of them. Even Addy, who is the freaking narrator, was an enigma wrapped in a mystery. As Beth points out at one point, Addy doesn't even know herself. And, lest you get confused, I don't mean that in a good,  Who am I?  YA thematic way. I mean, literally, Addy has no clue who the hell she is, why she's doing any of the things she gets involved in, why she likes anyone at all in the book (when they're all so unlikeable) or basically why she's even alive at this point.  Fourth, I really thought I might have an aneurysm when Coach invited the girls over (all of whom are inexplicably in love with Coach in a psuedo-lesbian manner, even though Coach is clearly emotionally abusive to them) and everyone just breaks out the white wine like it's nothing. I was also sick of Coach's White Whine through out the novel. WE GET IT. You've got an boring marriage. You've got a husband that would work himself to the bone to give you everything you've ever wanted. Talk about first world problems. Finally, because I realize this is getting long, what is left unsaid int his novel is not at all mysterious and thought-provoking. It's just poor storytelling. The Coach-girls relationship makes no sense and was rushed and underdeveloped. The weird obsession Addy has with Matt French seemed like it was going towards some kind of betrayal/affair angle, but went nowhere. The murder went nowhere (and kind of seemed like a rip off of the movie Unfaithful). All of the sudden, Beth, who had been painted as an unconscionable sociopath throughout the novel, is meant to appear sympathetic as she  forces' Addy to confront herself and her inner demons. And at one point the girls had a little lesbian tussle in the woods, which was apparently a BIGFUCKINGDEAL, even though Abbott couldn't be bothered describing it or the girls' feelings about it beyond some vague, surface imagery.  Had the ending not been so terrible, I would have rated it a little higher. I did love the concept and I loved the way Abbott doesn't shy away from the cruelty behind girl relationships. However, it seemed like Abbott was either confused or just gave up at one point and phoned it in from there.\",\n",

       "   \"The Good:  This book was exactly what I was expecting: a noirish thriller, dark and somewhat edgy, full of mean girls, and advancing the notion that the experiences we have in high school are some of the most dramatic and significant of our lives (which for some of us, I guess, they are). Entertaining, propulsive, and well written on its own terms (that last bit sounds like a backhanded compliment, but for this book it isn't—if you read it you'll see what I mean). Will this book change your life? Uh, no. Frankly, if you give this book five stars, you probably need to expand your reading horizons. But if this is the kind of book you're looking for, this is the one you should read. The Bad:  Oh, the language! It really worked my nerves sometimes. Make no mistake—it's clear that Megan Abbott is using language quite carefully to achieve a certain effect, and it works, but that doesn't mean I liked it. She makes up her own idioms. One character didn't turn white as a sheet, for instance—she  sheeted white.  And the cheerleaders' faces aren't red, they're  tomato-bursting.  And all the hyphenation! It was a bit much:  Stone-sinking.   Matchstick-snapped.   Boot-braced.  And, of course, Sparkle-slitted.  (Uh....) The Indifferent:  There seem to be people on Goodreads complaining that this book is unrealistic and the characters are unlikable. All that is definitely true. If you want likable and realistic, this is not the book for you. But if you just want to have a little no-commitment fun, you can do worse than this.\",\n",

       "   \"Let's be clear from the get go. If you want a more traditional review with a book summary, plot synopsis, and a character family tree, and then possibly a discussion on what the author was trying to accomplish in DARE ME and whether or not she actually achieved her goals, then you'll probably just want to slide it on back and move on to the next review. Because I'm about as non-traditional as they come. Instead, I like discussing how a book made me feel, or didn't feel, discussing writing insights where appropriate, tossing around similes and metaphors like used car parts in a Dumpster, and talking about my overall experience with a book, while taking into account my own knowledge of writing and reading and plain old random shit. In other words, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I have a damn good time being ignorant. So I'll start with this: Teenage girls are bitches and badasses. A female praying mantis treats her mate better than high school girls treat each other. And each manages to accomplish this task with a smile on her face and nothing but love in her heart, right before she brings out the icepick and wields it around the same way a construction worker might employ a two-by-four in the middle of a construction zone.  One might argue the mystery was a bit thin, but this book transcended the typical books in this genre, and proved there's more to a mystery than just the identity of the killer and the resolution of the crime. Instead, this was more about cheerleaders and their penchant to attack one another with vengeance, high school drama that unfolded before me on the page in pinks and purples and shades of red, and the extremes captains and coaches go to all in the name of victory. Yes, cheerleading is a sport, and in some parts of the country it's mentioned in the Sunday prayers along with football and your best friends Jim Bob and Clara Valentine. The shower scene in the girl's locker room at the beginning of this tale reminded me of all the times growing up that I would have practically handed over bodily organs to be given even a brief glimpse behind that steel curtain. But what made this story really click for me was the relationship between Addy Hanlon and Beth Cassidy, gal pals that dance a relationship tango better left choreographed to the professionals. And proves there's much more to a relationship than what's shown to the public. This tale was about as easy to swallow as cotton candy stuffed with razor blades, and now that I know what's behind the pom-poms I wish I could give it all back, since more knowledge isn't always the key to happiness, as this story aptly proves.

       "   \"4.0 stars  While not perfect, I have such warm feelings towards this novel. The story itself is incredibly compelling, pulling me in from the very first chapter. I did not expect to enjoy a book about high school cheerleaders so much. This novel is classified as a young adult, but personally I felt it is targeted at an older audience, despite the high school setting. The characters and story are purposely sensationalized and over the top. Megan Abbott's writing is raw and visceral, at times reminding me of Gillian Flynn or Laurie Halse Anderson. This story contains no moral lessons and is not particularly profound, yet was a decadent, delicious read. Unfortunately, the novel contained several narrative issues and would have benefited from further editing. Towards the end, the narration lost some its luster. I would have rated Dare Me higher if the ending had been stronger. Nevertheless, I was very impressed by Abbott's writing.\",\n",
       "   \"3.5 brutal stars. According to sports injury research, cheerleading is more dangerous than any other sport, with the rate of such injuries doubling between 1990 and 2002. For members of the Cheer Squad, captained by Beth Cassidy, there is less chance of being hurt by doing cheer stunts than by getting between Beth and Colette French, the new cheer coach. Beth rules the roost and she will do whatever it takes to anchor her position at the top of this pyramid. The story is told from the viewpoint of Addy Hanlon, Beth's life-long lieutenant. Cheerleading is of such importance to her that high school only exists so these girls can have a cheerleading squad. Coach French's appearance offers the possibility of the Squad to move from a bunch of girls who shaking their pom-poms into a competitive team of athletes. Beth sees the threat to her power immediately. Coach French initially behaves as any professional sport coach would be expected to behave - driven, disciplined, hard-shelled - until many of the members begin to see the progress they are making. At that point, the coach becomes part coach, part parent, part defiler of youth. All the women who make up this squad are “mean,” no one is exempt from the venom so easily and frequently sprayed and everyone is injured by the atmosphere that is allowed to fester. When a tragic event occurs, Beth is offered the opportunity to regain her place as “owner” of the Cheerleaders. Addy is caught between loyalty to her friend, her coach, and her team. She is not innocent in any of the events which seem to envelope her, but neither is she party to the subterfuge that sparked those events. The book shows the writing talent of Ms. Abbott. She highlights well the tension, confusion, anger, angst, and isolation experienced by all the girls. The world she creates is largely parent-free, which is difficult to comprehend. Addy and Beth are out at all hours of the night, leave home whenever they want, yet are never confronted by anyone in authority for their behavior. They ingest various substances, most illegal, rarely eat (or even retain what they do eat) but have no ill-effects from such behavior. For athletes in training for the “Big Game” where “the scout for regionals” will be in attendance, they show little commitment to staying healthy for that event. This undercurrent caused the story to be less believable and less plausible. The ending is well done, having drawn the reader in an entirely different direction until the moment when the curtain is lifted high enough to reveal the hidden truth about each of the characters.\"],\n",

In a time of political unrest, Varina Westcott, a young widow and candle maker for court and church, agrees to perform a clandestine service for Queen Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII--carve wax figures of four dead children, two of her offspring lost in infancy and her two brothers, the Princes of the Tower, whose mysterious disappearance years ago has never been solved.

       "  'review': [\"WINNER OF GR GIVEAWAY Even with all the Tudor hoopla; little seems to be known about Elizabeth of York, the mother of Henry VIII. Karen Harper's “Mistress of Mourning” attempts to offer an insight into Elizabeth's view of the disappearance of her princely brothers and of the death her son, Arthur.  “Mistress of Mourning” instantly off put my reading satisfaction by introducing the character of Varina Wescott with nothing more than elementary flair. Instead of “living” through or even with Varina; Harper spends too much time simply telling the character's back story instead of following a natural, developmental arch. Furthermore, there is no gripping factor surrounding Varina and therefore the reader never truly roots for her throughout the novel. Plus, Varina lacks vigor, is very one dimensional, and has thoughts which remind me of an annoying teenager. Basically, her character isn't solid or overly accessible and/or likable. Harper does try to supplement this character by presenting “Mistress of Mourning” with alternating view points/storytelling by Varina and Elizabeth of York. Although Harper successfully distinguishes between the two voices which sets them a part (Elizabeth possesses way more poise than Varina); the swaps occur too often which prevents the reader from truly getting to know one character from another. It almost felt like Harper had two separate book ideas with each being unfinished and decided to try to combine them.  On a positive note, “Mistress of Mourning” was interesting when explaining the art form of candle making and wax effigies. Harper clearly did her research and sparks curiosity to the topic. The Tudor elements, however, are somewhat bland (although they include  some  accurate facts); and make Elizabeth of York seem crazy in her quest for answers to the mystery surrounding her brothers and Arthur's death.  The entire novel is unbelievable and is a case example of a good idea with poor execution. The romance between Varina and Nicholas Sutton lacks intensity, growth, and chemistry; while the mystery elements are plain ridiculous and obviously untrue. There are several, “Are you serious?!” moments. Plus, “Mistress of Mourning” is very rushed with the feeling that something of substance will happen but it never does. For those who enjoy literary language and illustrious settings… you won't find that here. Those are missing elements, as well.  Also unbelievable (and extremely grating) were the love scenes between Varina and Nicholas. Again, not only did they lack chemistry and feel forced but also were comparable to a high school-level couple. I would have even preferred a Fabio romance at this point! Although seemingly small details, I couldn't stand Varina  CONSTANTLY  having “tears in her eyes” (which depleted her characterization even more); or the fact that the characters called the King and Queen “Your Majesty” when that title wasn't in use until the time of Henry VIII.  The conclusion of the novel is anti-climatic, predictable, and too “happily ever after”. This will certainly upset those readers who were by now annoyed with the already poor book. “Mistress of Mourning” is barely above a fairy tale with fantastical ghosts, witches, etc. It is hardly a historical fiction novel and much too high on the fluff ladder. I am not a fan of Harper's Queen Elizabeth mini-series (I only read one because it was so terrible), yet “Mistress of Mourning” is even worse. Truly only recommended for those not seeking any depth or historical credibility. Had I not won this on GR, I would have not been inclined to finish it.\",\n",

       "   \"Find the enhanced version of this and other reviews at:  http://flashlightcommentary.blogspot.... Can I be honest? I think it helped that I didn't have any expectations going into this one. I was excited about the premise of Karen Harper's Mistress of Mourning but because I didn't have any preconceived ideas about the book, I wasn't upset that it fell on the lighter side of historic fiction. The story isn't bad, I just think if I'd been craving a hard hitting historic piece as is more my norm, this one would have left me wanting. The characters fit the time period which is more than I can say for a lot of published works. Varina is a great example in that she is possessed of an independent streak yet she isn't so modern minded as to seem inappropriate in Tudor England. Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Arthur and Catherine read a little flat for my tastes but as they are largely supporting characters it is something I'm willing to overlook. Really the only character I didn't like was young Henry VIII. I think Harper allowed history to dictate her storytelling a little. Just once I'd love to see an author downplay the younger Tudor prince and really guide the reader towards Arthur. Here, as with most if not all the Tudor fiction I've read, the Prince of Wales gets less face time with the reader and though his death is key to the plot, his character is largely overshadowed by the Duke of York. I really liked what Harper did with Arthur's death in terms of resolving the circumstances of his demise but I wasn't as thrilled with the story of Elizabeth's brothers. Harper started out strong, interweaving the two storylines but the finale left me feeling 'eh.' Maybe it was too much to tie together. Maybe it was because we never got into our villain's head or really understood his motivations. Maybe I'm bias in that I am unconsciously comparing Mistress in Mourning to Robin Maxwell's To the Tower Born. Maybe I just feel the latter solution seemed anticlimactic against the drama of Arthur's situation. Whatever the reason I think the combined plots were a little too much for Harper to take on. Finally, I don't think Harper played the setting to its best advantage. I've read books featuring Ludlow before and I've seen an author bring this particular setting to life. Guess I'm just a little sad that Harper seemed to let it fall by the way side. Researching is easy; anyone can look up the historic notes on a particular place and time. To my mind, the key in fictionalizing the past is not simply recreating people or events, the same care needs to be taken in re-imagining the world they inhabit. There isn't anything wrong or particularly upsetting in what Harper achieved here, I've just think there is room to improve.  As always I would like to note that I'm harder on historic fiction writers than I am authors of any other genre. They are my favorite storytellers and so I hold them to a slightly higher standard. My commentary here comes off as nitpicky and critical but I really did enjoy Harper's work and look forward to reading more of it in the future. \",\n",
       "   'One of my favorite periods of history is the War of the Roses and the Tudor Dynasty that starts after. In this book we have Elizabeth the Good, wife of Henry VII, who is grieving the loss of two of her children and her perceived part in the loss of her brothers, the Princes who were lost in the Tower. Elizabeth hires Varina Westcott to make wax effigies of them and ends up enlisting her to help discover if her son, Prince Arthur, was killed. Varina falls in love with Nick, who helps her in her hunt for the truth. Just so you know, they do get their HEA ;)  If you like this time period, this is a great theory on what happened to the Princes :) ',\n",
       "   \"Set squarely in the world of 16th century merchants, our heroine, Varina Westcott, is a young widow with a thriving candle-making business. Mourning the loss of her infant son, Varina devotes her time to making beautiful, lifelike angel candles which are sold illicitly as she isn't a member of the city's powerful candle-making guild. As if fending off her predatory suitor isn't challenge enough, she accepts a mysterious commission from the royal palace, which, unsurprisingly, has an enormous impact on her life. Her client is none other than Queen Elizabeth of York, the wife of Henry VII. Still grieving the untimely deaths of her brothers -- the infamous princes in the Tower -- as well as her two infant children, Elizabeth finds in Varina a kindred spirit. But Varina's seemingly simple commission -- to design wax effigies of Elizabeth's dead kin -- transforms into a more challenging job when Varina is asked to investigate the sudden and mysterious death of Prince Arthur (as in big brother of Henry VIII). There's a predictable romance that I rather liked with a male love interest who was, I'll admit, kind of dreamy. The novel is split between her first person account and that of Queen Elizabeth, and while I'm not always wild about dual narratives, in this case, it worked. The common loss these two women shared added some depth to this otherwise enjoyably fluffy historical. What sold me on the story, and why I so enjoyed this book, is that Varina worked for me as a heroine -- even when she came dangerously close to that aggravating willful-feisty caricature. She waited out tense situations rather than doing something stupid, for example, and I found her admirable and likeable. (And, yes, I totally want her to be my bestie.) I can't speak to the novel's historical accuracy. Harper's conjecture about who murdered the princes in the Tower and the cause of Arthur's death might not resonate with those who are armchair historians of that era, but since I don't know, I didn't care, and I liked the mix of history, romance, and intrigue. Ultimately, this is the best kind of summer historical fiction: light but not insultingly so, with an obvious romance to counter the dark conspiracy. Tudor fans might enjoy this with it's early Tudor roots; those who like artisans and women-who-do-unusual-jobs will find Harper's candle-making research fascinating.\",\n",

       "   \"This is a rather disappointing novel with two very dull main characters. The plot takes an age to get going and it's all an odd combination of over-written melodrama and unlikely, almost laughable plotting. I was so glad when I finally got to the end.\",\n",
       "   \"An interesting yarn set in London in 1501, Elizabeth of York is married to King Henry Vll and she is mourning the loss of her two younger brothers 'the princes in the tower' who disappeared without trace. The queen is then faced with additional grief when her son the young prince Arthur, recently married to Catherine of Aragon dies. The queen has heard of a widow who runs a candle making business and who also carves beautiful death candles with angels and the queen asks her to take on the funeral of Arthur and also to make likenesses of her brothers in wax. The candle maker Varina Westcott is a very gifted sculptor and is soon coming and going into the palace in secret to do the wax modelling for the queen. The story is a bit on the wishy washy side and Varina is often moist of eye, she also falls in love with Nicholas Sutton and aide to the royal couple. The Character of Varina is not as strong as it should be for a woman who has overcome so much to be able to run her own business in those days and I wanted her to be shown as more capable and less susceptible to romance. I was fascinated to read all about the process of candle making and funeral procedures in the Tudor times and this was the part of the book that was good for me. I was surprised that in the Author notes at the end of the book Ms Harper states: 'If King Richard was behind the boys' (the princes in the tower) murders, perhaps it is some sort of justice that, during the Reformation, his bones were thrown in the River Stour and his tomb was used as a horse trough and later broken up.' It was only hearsay that his happened, no one knew what happened to the body of Richard lll and history has proved the statement above to be completely wrong. King Richard was buried in Leicester in a grave with no coffin just a shroud (hence no horse trough) and since he was reburied in Leicester cathedral he was definitely not thrown in to the river. The events surrounding his ignominious burial have never been known until now. Overall this was an entertaining read though very light, I would read others by this author bearing in mind that they are definite fiction. \",\n",
       "   \"An engrossing read, this book contains a bit of everything. There's a romance, mystery, historical tidbits, and suspense. The rousing tale of two women caught up in the strictures of grief overcoming it to solve the mystery of who's gunning for the Tudor dynasty kept me on the edge of my seat. I liked that the author was able to balance the different elements into one streaming and smooth story. I especially liked Varina. She's got guts, courage, and a caring heart. Though a bit blind at times to the emotions of those surrounding her, she's an intelligent woman who dedicates herself to serving her Queen and protecting her family and loved ones. I also liked that she was practical in her perceived expectations for her future, yet there was still a bit of the romantic in her to not immediately jump on the first marriage proposal to come her way. There were a ton of neat historical tidbits throughout the story: details of the burial practices of early Tudor England, some of the magic still present in the rural folklore, the role of women in the time period, and the mechanics of running a business in bustling London. Those historical tidbits made for a fun read for any history lover. Yet, there wasn't much meaty stuff here. The details were fun, yet a lot of stuff seemed a bit far-fetched to me to have actually happened. Elizabeth's wax effigies in hiding, the lightning fast speed of Nick's and Varina's romance, and the varying roles that Varina played all seem a bit out there to me. The hypothesis the author puts forward for why Arthur died and responsible party behind the Princes in the Tower were intriguing, though. A fun read, this book will definitely kill a weekend for you. It's got some neat historical tidbits, a great lead, and a thrilling plot. And while it may not have a lot of meat on its bones when it comes to historical weight and story, I think this novel would still be very enjoyable for any historical fiction lover.\",\n",
       "   \"I reviewed this book for  www.luxuryreading.com The twisting mysteries throughout Mistress of Mourning were a pleasant surprise as I was expecting a more traditional historical fiction story. Karen Harper presents tiny pieces of the puzzle throughout the narrative with the final pieces not falling into place until the very end. She gives us clear answers to the questions regarding the disappearance of the Princes of the Tower as well as the death of Prince Arthur and even gives reasons why she reached these conclusions in her author notes.   Mistress of Mourning alternates between Varina and Queen Elizabeth as narrator and while Varina is by far the larger focus, I found Elizabeth's point of view to be just as essential to the story. As the daughter, sister, niece and wife to Kings of England, she presents a side to the history unlike any other. Her presentation as a gentle, kind woman who is at the same time manically grieving and determined to find out the truth behind the strange deaths of her loved ones is quite compelling and sorrowful. I have often thought she would make a complex, interesting subject for a novel and that is exactly what this book gives us.   This is not my first Karen Harper book and will definitely not be my last. I would recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction, mysteries or characters that are multi-faceted and not always what they seem.\",\n",
       "   'What a great read!! Varina Wescott has been sworn to secrecy by Queen Elizabeth of York, having been commissioned to sculpt effigies of her dead children and her missing brothers in the tower. As Varina deals with her overbearing suitor, and her growing affection for Nicholas Sutton, she is trying to figure out many things about herself and her future.  When she is asked by Queen Elizabeth to go with Nicholas Sutton to Wales to attend to the body of the Prince, after his untimely death, and to find out if foul play was involved. Death seems to follow Varina. With her business mainly being funerary candles, it is not unlikely, but it also bring it to the forefront for her. She must confront one of her demons to get her son back alive, and she must also attempt to figure out who is trying to kill the King and Queen and their family and why.  Will she be successful for not?? I loved this book! It was quite interesting, but it also had some historical inaccuracies that as time has now shown are wrong. Being written when it was, some of the facts were not known, but there were also a few issues of guessing. Overall this book was wonderful! It was pretty clean, and the book itself was wonderful. This is one that I would read again!',\n",
       "   \" Yet was Her Majesty's grief any greater than mine when others had buried my dear son and I had watched from afar? Or was her joy any deeper than mine when we bore our sons and first looked upon their tiny faces? Not a bit, I swore to myself. And that was why, queen or citizen, highborn or low, we women were sisters under the skin no matter what befell us.  The premise of Karen Harper's  Mistress of Mourning  (also called  The Queen's Confidante , but I prefer the first title) is, to be honest, kind of ludicrous. In 1501, widowed chandler and waxwoman Varina Westcott is secretly commissioned by Elizabeth of York to construct wax effigies of her deceased children and brothers (the Princes in the Tower). The two women bond over their shared grief, and when Prince Arthur dies mysteriously, Varina is dispatched to Wales alongside hunky love interest Nicholas Sutton to determine whether he met with foul play... Yet I know what I hate - and I don't hate this. For what it is - a fairly light historical romance/mystery - I found myself pleasantly surprised by  Mistress of Mourning . Yes, the idea that Prince Arthur's death was suspicious is completely unfounded, but given that the idea's so central to the book, you kind of just have to go along with it. Varina's occupation is not something I've come across in historical fiction before, and I thought it a fascinating choice by Harper. It's an interesting way to give Varina access to the queen and the royal court, and affords her more agency than she otherwise might have, although the difficulties she faces as a widow are still made clear when she has to fend off an unwanted suitor. Varina isn't a particularly interesting character beyond her profession, but nor is she irritating or unlikeable. Similarly, her love interest Nicholas (call him Nick, he insists!) is perfectly inoffensive. Their budding romance is fairly bland - their attraction is made obvious from the get-go, and they don't face any major roadblocks. And while Nicholas Sutton is a perfectly acceptable name for a 15th/16th century figure, reading about a character called Nick in this time period just felt jarring - he might as well have been called Chad or Jason. Particularly when you have someone like Henry VII addressing him by his first name, which would never have happened. Elizabeth's desire to have life-sized wax figures of her dead children and brothers is a deeply bizarre request, and it's a testament to Harper's writing of her that she comes across as brave and stoic instead of totally unhinged by grief. Her relationship with Henry VII is a high point of this novel for me. Contrasting neatly with Varina and Nick's bland romance, their marriage is loving, yet difficult and complex, and has the potential to be torn asunder entirely by a secret revealed only at the book's very end. Their scenes together provide a level of nuance rarely seen in this type of story. Sure, there were a few things that made me roll my eyes - Harper's insistence that Elizabeth was called 'Elizabeth the Good' by her subjects (she wasn't); the cartoon villainy of Varina's suitor Christopher Gage; the future Henry VIII coming across as obnoxious and calculating, even as a child. The ending, as well, is pretty lame - it kind of just peters out, with a confession that would have resonated far more if it had come earlier. But, when so many books set in this time period are very much  Yorkists good, Tudors bad ,  Mistress of Mourning  sets itself apart by providing a more balanced offering. (Funnily enough, Harper has very little to say about Richard III, although one of his closest allies plays a major role.) If you're looking for a fairly light read set in the early Tudor period, you could do far worse than this book.\",\n",
       "   \"[It seemed like Varina's only qualification for the investigation is that no one knew of her connection with the queen. She hadn't previously been involved with any mysteries, and she didn't know any of the people. She travels to Wales with Nicholas Sutton, a gentleman who was previously a Yorkist but now serves in the Tudor court and is looking for advancement.  The mystery/suspense is told backwards - Nicholas is convinced that all the deaths were caused by Lord Lovell, a Yorkist who continued to rebel after the death of Richard III. He doesn't give any evidence for this, but after a while Varina also considers Lord Lovell to be the villain. Eventually this is found to be true when he kidnaps Varina's son, I felt this to be due to luck and wishful thinking, not because of any clues given earlier in the book. Also, Lovell gives his reason for attacking the Tudors - Henry was responsible for the deaths of the princes in the tower - but no one seems to care. He's a Yorkist so lets lock him up and continue with things as they are.  Modern (20th/21st century) mysteries with female detectives have a trope where the main character is put in danger by the criminal near the end of the book but either escapes or is rescued and reveals the solution. This trope was used in this book - Varina and her son Arthur are locked in a secret compartment of Lord Lovell's castle and are rescued when guards hear them screaming through a chink in the stone wall. This part made me think of modern stories, rather than the historical side.   (hide spoiler) ]\",\n",
       "   \"Alright, so I was recommended this as it suggested that if I like Phillipa Gregory, then I'll love Karen Harper. Although I did enjoy the book, it wasn't the most readable. Varina Westcott is a widow who runs a wax chandlery shop that she inherited from her late husband. She is asked by Queen Elizabeth of York to create wax effigies of her brothers (The Princes in the Tower) and her two dead children. They bond as they have both lost children. When her eldest son, Prince Arthur Tudor dies mysteriously at Ludlow Castle with his new wife Catherine of Aragon, Elizabeth appoints Varina to help uncover the plot behind her son's death. Since discovering Phillipa Gregory, I have become a fan of historical fiction. Harper has picked the roots of the Tudor era, and as such is able to dig and interpret 2 mysteries that still remain unsolved - the death of The Princes in the Tower and the death of Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales. Harper is able to write her own answers to these mysteries, and I thought they were brilliantly entertwined with the story. Harper also shows that anxiety and depression that Elizabeth still feels after the death of her brothers. The plot overall was good, but it took a while for me to get into the story. The book itself isn't as readable as Gregory, I found myself having to read sentences a couple of times to understand what Harper meant. I wouldn't not recommend this book however, as it shows Varina making her way through the plot without the assistance of a man (one trait which she doesn't realise). This makes her both desirable and a hindrance to those who seek her affections.\",\n",
       "   \"this was a great book for those who enjoy mysteries set in the Tudor period--specifically Henry VII--and also has intersting insight into the murders of the 2 princes in the Tower and also young Prince Arthur Tuor, who died supposedly of a sudden illness. The book is told from the POV of a young woman chandler/waxmaker named Varina Westcott who is summoned to the palace to work for the Queen Elizabeth of York, who wants her to make wax effigies of her two dead children, one of whom was a baby, and her two lost brothers, presumed murdered by their uncle Richard III. Varina is talented but denied entrance into her local guild because she is a woman, despite running her own shop since she was widowed and also has sympathy for the queen because she too suffered the loss of a child to sickness. Ironically both their lost sons were named Edmund, and Varina has a small boy named Arthur, named for the eldest prince.  Varina is quickly enmeshed, through no fault of her own, in a web of intrigue and murder, and made the target of a dangerous man who wishes to topple the Tudors. She forms an alliance with a loyal queen's man named Nicholas Sutton who helps her to investigate the strange happenings.  Alongside Varina is Elizabeth of York, a kind and generous queen, the daughter of Edward IV, whose marriage to Henry VIII brought an end to the Cousin's War--what is now called the War of the Roses--between Lancaster and York. Elizabeth is haunted by dreams of failing to protect her two little brothers in the Tower and is determined to find out who killed them, since the actual killers were never found. Oddly enough, her husband doesn't seem too eager to put the murders to rest, and thinks she grieves too much over her dead children and her brothers and so Elizabeth swears Varina and Nicholas to secrecy about the wax effigies. She hides them in a secret room that she says is for her devotions. I was happy to see that Harper doesn't go down the well worn trail of accusing Richard of murdering his nephews, and instead uses deduction and logic to show the possible and more likely suspect of another powerful figure. She also puts forth another interesting mystery in the form of Arthur's death, and shows how precarious the reign of the Tudors was on the throne until Henry VIII, who won the hearts of most of the people in the beginning of his reign. I enjoyed Varina and Elizabeth's POV, the mystery was well done, and so was the romance between Nick and Varina. \",\n",
       "   \"Lovely book, with a lot of historical detail, suspense, and a love story. The background to this is the life of Elizabeth of York, the loss of her two brothers, the princes in the tower, the loss of her own son. Varina is the Mistress of Mourning, a chandler employed for a covert operation to carve wax figures of Elizabeth's two sons and also the her nephews, the princes in the tower. The novel tells the two parallel stories, Varina, a widow who has also lost a child and is sympathetic to Elizabeth's loss. Meantime Varina who has a surviving child, becomes involved with Nicholas Sutton, a handsome and engaging suitor with his own issues. There is a lot of adventure during which Varina and her son Arthur are in jeopardy, will the handsome Nicholas come to their rescue? Read on for more.

She was proud when she needed to be, and highly heartbroken after the loss of her two children.  - The bond between Varina and Elizabeth of York. It was so beautifully written and my favorite part of the book. - The dual perspective between Varina and Elizabeth of York. It was beautifully done and flowed from one narrator to the other clearly. - The characterisation of Elizabeth of York. She was written exactly how I see her as. I loved the intimate and personal scenes between her and Henry Tudor. Their marriage was really well portrayed. - The detail to the candle and embalming references. At times they were so detailed it was haunting. - How the book made me think is history all it seems? Did Arthur Tudor really die of the sweating sickness? Which we know he did but what if a Tudor enemy killed him in the hope to restore the Plantagenet rule? What I didn't like: - It was anticlimatic. I felt like the ending was rushed. Even the announcement of who the killer was, made me unsatisfied with how it was played out. - It was dragged out. I feel like quite a few pages could've been cut and nothing would've been lost.  - It was not as atmospheric as I would've liked. Yes Harper had all the candle lingo to a tee, but the supposedly spooky scenes in the dungeons didn't do it for me. Even like Varina, I don't like enclosed spaces, but the scenes where she felt confined didn't bother me. - The characterisation wasn't remarkable. The supporting characters mostly weren't that interesting, though there was a scene where young Henry confronts his mother and was rather beastly to her. That did give me chills, once again we see sparks of how Henry will be as Henry VIII in years to come. - The death of Elizabeth of York was rushed. Okay, we know she died in childbirth and I liked how that scene was presented but it needed to be longer.  Summary: Okay, so I borrowed this book at the library. It caught my eye, and I gave it a go. I'm utterly fascinated by Elizabeth of York, so I was so happy when I saw the book was told from her POV.  It was a great read in some places but it fell flat by the end, but I'll definitely read this author again. Why? Because I like her characterisation of Elizabeth and Henry, and also I have on my tbr her book, “Shakespeare's Mistress.”\",\n",

       "  'review': [\"My literary sweet tooth is cheesy formula thriller writers from the 60s and 70s: Alastair MacLean, Hammond Innes, and Desmond Bagley. Of the three, my sense is that Bagley has best survived the changing times and literary fashions. To be sure, none of them wrote the 800 page brainkillers that became popular in the 80s; but their 250-page novels are well-plotted, expertly written, and rarely feel over-long.  Running Blind  is a pursuit story: a spy courier is attacked on a milk run, he suspects his boss is lying to him, his fiance becomes involved, and they chase and are chased across Iceland. The spy knows his guns, naturally, but is a Scot and his weapon of choice is his  sgian dubh  (the small knife Highlanders carry in their hose under the kilt). His gun lore extends beyond movie cliches: buildings do not provide protection against gunfire, so at one point the hero outside the house shoots the baddies (how can you not think of stories like this in terms of the hero and the baddies?) as they hide beside windows inside the house.  One by one, though, the books I've returned to since childhood are losing their potency. Alastair MacLean's alcoholism lets down all but his first books, and it takes fewer novels to bore me every time I dive back into Dick Francis.  Running Blind  still shines, but even its luster is fading: the early reveal and long mcguffin-driven chase mean it's a novel that focuses on action rather than on suspense or mystery. If it were written today, the editor would request a last-minute reveal and a change in the character over the course of the book. But it was written in the 1970s and square-jawed men fighting off swarthy rogues is what the time demanded, and I can't fault its delivery on that front.\",\n",
       "   \"Still an awesome read, and I've read this one so often the spine's disintegrating. Well-written, literate, and intelligent spy-thriller.\",\n",
       "   \"Alan Stewart has been out of the  Department  for a few years and is finding life in Iceland to his liking. Then he ends up with a dead stranger at his feet and is quickly subsumed into a situation where Russians, British and mavericks seem to collide in a Cold War themed thriller. With very sound descriptions of Iceland, its countryside and features, there are bad guys and good guys, and some who seem good but are certainly bad, trying to get track each other and obtain some things that are important to all. Desmond Bagley's story is a little formulaic in 2018, but in 1970 it was a big-seller and his plots had strong links to the real , including the politics of the day, and importantly too the technologies being used and pushed ever further in capability by scientists. An enjoyable and quick read with spies, chases and love all present in volcanic Iceland. \",\n",
       "   \"I re-started reading Bagley after a friend of mine said he aged well. And he's right - Bagley reads much better than Maclean now that I'm older.\",\n",
       "   \"Retired British secret agent Alan Stewart is blackmailed into doing a simple job. He just has to drop off a package to his contact in Iceland and then he can spend the rest of the summer with his Icelandic girlfriend Elin. However, things go pear-shaped from the outset. Has he been set up? And what do the Americans and Russians have to do with it? There are plenty of twists and turns as Alan and Elin trek halfway across Iceland to escape double-crossers and would-be assassins. What's in the package that's so important? And who will get out of this mess alive? I've read a few Desmond Bagleys, but this is the first in a long time. It's a bit  boys' own  for my current tastes, but there was still a lot to enjoy. Bagley knows how to craft a well-paced adventure story with lots of suspense, and it was interesting to see how Alan and Elin would get out of one death-defying situation after another. It was also a Cold War 'blast from the past' and easier to follow than some of the more intricate modern spy thrillers. I liked the way that Iceland's natural setting played a main part in the action. It's a country I don't know much about, so I was happy to go along for the ride. It also raised some interesting issues about ethics in espionage. For example, is it moral to sacrifice good men for a greater cause? It was published in 1970 and would have been cutting edge at the time, complete with a couple of mentions of the moon landing from the previous year. Apparently Neil Armstrong and other Apollo astronauts did some training there due to the similarity of Icelandic geological features and those on the moon. Though I had a chuckle at one piece of outdated technology. Alan phones his boss Taggart in London and asks him to find out some information about another agent. When his boss says it will take a couple of hours, Alan says that the answer is just a button press away:  The fast, computer-controlled retrieval of microfilm combined with the wonders of closed circuit television would put an answer on to the screen on his desk in much less than two minutes providing the right coding was dialled . Ahh ... technology! There were a few lapses of political correctness, but then it was the 70s. I liked the characters enough that I wanted them to beat the bad guys, but I didn't really feel an emotional connection to them. It was more of a plot-driven book than a character-driven one, even though it's written in first person POV from the main character. Overall, an enjoyable holiday read. \",\n",
       "   \"As a child/teenager I absolutely loved the ”simple” suspense novels by Desmond Bagley & Alistair MacLean, eating up every word. Triggered by an audio adaption of Landslide I fell upon, I decided to revisit Desmond Bagley to see if the Novels could withstand the wear of more than 35 years. The first (pleasant) surprise was that even though I thought I had read all the books, not all were translated to Danish at that time, so I could start out with a couple of new experiences. The Golden Keel (1963) , High Citadel (1965) , Wyatt's Hurricane (1966) The first 3 books, all new to me, were pleasant surprises and it was plain to see why Bagley so quickly became a best-seller novelist, the stories are well written with a fast pace and a sense of detail which makes them readable even today.  Landslide (1967) Landslide was a revisit and one of my favorites both back then and now, the story is catching and has a definite film manuscript feeling about it,  The Vivero Letter (1968) Another “new” novel, it was not as strong as the first 4 but still enjoyable. The Spoilers (1969) Another new novel and a definitely low point, the story is weak and utterly unbelievable. Running Blind (1970) Another reread and another favorite, maybe his best novel, the story is strong, the setting in Iceland is brilliant and characters, simple as they are, are believable.  The Freedom Trap (1971) , The Tightrope Men (1973) ,The Snow Tiger (1975), The Enemy (1977)  Flyaway (1978), Bahama Crisis (1980), Windfall (1982), Night Of Error (1984), Juggernaut (1985)\",\n",

The Fontana edition has a peculiar cover, more Haynes manual than adventure story.',\n",
       "   \"This was a real treat. As a kid, my dad had a pile of Desmond Bagley, Hammond Innes & Alistair MacLean books. Many of the books are out of print now so it was nice to find Desmond Bagley's books on audio now. I really enjoyed this one. I tend to find a lot of modern  Men's Adventure  novels fairly uninteresting but I feel the godfathers of Men's Adventure like Bagley did it right. Running Blind is a really enjoyable thriller and more than stands up after all these decades.\",\n",
       "   \" It'll be simple,  his contact had said.  You'll be a messenger, that's all.  Ex-British Intelligence agent Alan Stewart foolishly thought he had retired from the game and was safely hidden away among the plentiful Stewarts found in Scotland. But when his old boss needs a courier for a top-secret package, he blackmails Stewart into playing the game one more time. It's supposed to be an easy hand-off in Iceland, no problem at all for Stewart who speaks the language like a native and who has the cover of a girlfriend in the country and regular fishing trips to Iceland to mask his real purpose.  Stewart isn't buying the purported cakewalk nature of the job, though, and his instincts prove correct when less than an hour after he lands in Iceland he finds himself on a lonely road standing over the body of a man who had ambushed him and planned to make off with the booty. Stewart is reassured to know that his instincts are still sound and his reflexes as sharp as ever. What bothers him is the fact that he thought nobody but his own team knew he had traveled to Keflavik International Airport. It soon becomes apparent that not only his position is compromised, but so is the safety of Elin, the girl he loves. The two of them become embroiled in a cross-country race for their lives with a fairly violent denouement in store, made all the more difficult because Stewart no longer knows whom he can trust.  Running Blind (1970) by Desmond Bagley is far less a mystery than a spy action thriller with definite ties to the time period. Not that it's so dated that it loses much of its entertainment factor. Bagley writes a quality spy thriller with lots of action, lots of killing, but a solid story surrounding our hero and the reasons for his adventures. It's a good taste of the Cold War days with the MI6 good guys teaming up with those CIA yanks and taking on those Russian KGB thugs. There are spies and counterspies, and double-agents all mixed in with a good piece of misdirection and misinformation. The only drawback is the rather longish, extended chase through the mid-section of the book--that got to be just a bit too much. Otherwise, a good solid espionage story ringing in at ★★★ and a half--rounded to four here. First posted on my blog  My Reader's Block . Please request permission before reposting. Thanks.\",\n",
       "   \"I was reluctant to read this book because I was concerned that a spy novel of the 70s might have technology that are too dated and make the characters & their actions seem inefficient. I was wrong, it was fine. The action was still solid. This was spy vs. spy vs. spy plus yankees.That main character is a retired British gentleman/deadly spy. His love interest is a TOUGH Icelandic woman. A very solid spy novel. MAJOR SPOILER/BOOK SUMMARY: So I think what happened was... American scientist came up with a useless device but then decided to trick the Russians into thinking it was something major. The Brits then, in cahoots with the Americans, pretended to be annoyed and  stole  a piece of the device. They leaked info to Russia so that the Russians, in turn, would steal it and generally be super worried and research something that doesn't actually exist. The Brits pick up Alan to do the  losing  of the device but doesn't let him in on it. Things gets even MORE complicated because Alan's mid-boss is actually a Russian double agent who's trying to climb up the ladder and he's hauled in Alan's ex nemesis (whose balls he shot off) Kennikin. BUT ALSO Kennikin was unknowingly betrayed by the same mid-boss back in the day so the mid-boss could move up the ladder. Alan, not knowing he was supposed to lose the device, got too clever about not handing it over. Lots of agents on both sides die due to this little spy mindfuck game.\",\n",
       "   \"I read this book back in the Seventies and I was delighted to find it available on ereader. Frankly I wondered whether it would be dated, but it really hasn't. OK you have to get used to the lack of mobile 'phones, the fact that people smoke and that there is still a cold war on! However, people can forgive the classics because they're set in the past, no reason they can't do the same for this excellently paced, tight plotted thriller. The writing is still fresh and easy to read. It transports you to, and makes you want to see, Iceland and it gives you the feeling of authenticity with every word. Really enjoyed it!\",\n",
       "   \"Running Blind is my favourite Bagley book, where our hero is trying to deliver a package in Iceland while being chaed by the Russians. Total page-turner thriller where you never know what will happen next. It's a great read for anyone that is interested in Iceland - dozens of places are visited in the book and each is authentically described by the author. All the great places in Iceland you've heard of like Geysir and Gullfoss. I love this book and have re-read it many times.\",\n",
       "   \"Bagley in excelsis: the narrative starts in media res with the stakes high. The pace only increases and the stakes only get higher. The tension is constant, the action scenes handled with aplomb, and the Icelandic setting is evoked with the kind of descriptive skill that Hammond Innes was known for. 'Running Blind' marks Bagley's shift towards the espionage genre, and he handles the transition with skill and confidence.\",\n",
       "   \"A book stolen from my fathers cache of books when I was a teen, it was my entry point into Bagleys particular style of action thriller, and led me to seek out his other books at the public library, I've not read it in over 20 years, but it inspired me to visit Iceland, and for that alone it's one of my fave books.\",\n",
       "   \"Somewhat dated compared to more modern entries in the genre, it nonetheless has a certain classic charm, an exotic location, well-rounded characters and a dynamic thread that never lets up until it's conclusion. My favourite Bagley book, it's on my annual read list.\",\n",
       "   \"One of my all time favourites. Desmond Bagley's novels make you feel nostalgic about those bygone eras of 70s and 80s. I must re-read most of his books 3 times on average. His books are packed with feel-good stuff. \",\n",

       "   \"I enjoyed this book very much. Nobody could deny that Running Blind is formulaic, but that is emphatically not a criticism, for sometimes great pleasure can be had from art which operates within strict parameters. Bagley does this with much success, keeping us in the reassuringly familiar milieu of the spy novel, whilst maintaining an enviable narrative propulsion and leavening his dough with an unfamiliar setting — the action takes place on the lonely roads and passes of Iceland. There is some double dealing in the plot, and a smattering of moral ambiguity, but Bagley is no Le Carré, rather I think I'd place him more aptly in the muscular tradition of Buchan and Fleming - no bad place to be at all. This was the first of Bagley's books I've read (I found it on a wall!), and I'm minded to seek out more. \",\n",
       "   \"An atmospheric spy novel, set in the background of the Cold War with enough action to keep you entertained, alongside an intriguing plot. Not groundbreaking or excellent, but still an entertaining read. The setting of this story in Iceland was a nice touch and the description throughout the story of the unique geography and beauty of Iceland was really well done.  The musings on the morality of spies, how they operate and how it is often an amoral pursuit is well done, especially on the attempted use as a pawn of the hero protagonist of the novel was a strong theme throughout.  The conclusion was cleverly done. The book at times showed its age with its language and at points the story did not feel fully developed.  This was a good spy novel without being brilliant. That's why I've given it four out of five stars.\",\n",
       "   'Another of those Desmond Bagley novels which makes you tear your hair in helplessness. At the meaninglessly meandering storytelling which he brings about to unsettle the readers who are following the plot and the intrigue he had built up through more than half of his novel. Set in idyllic Iceland, this cold-war period spy thriller moves at a furious pace, with several enjoyable episodes of deception, gun-battles, death and destruction. Till the author realizes that he has given us too much of a good thing and tries to make amends with downright drivel. But the pace set in early takes the story through to its climax, nevertheless, much to the relief of the readers.',\n",
       "   'Succinctly put, an enthralling spy thriller. The story revolves around a deception operation assigned to a retired spy, who, although devoid of any hint of the purpose of the operation, is chased for his life, through the magnificent landscape of Iceland. The suspense is carried meticulously throughout the book on one hand, while exquisitely describing the breathtaking scenery of the land of Fire and Ice (Iceland) - glaciers, geysers and lava fields, on the other. The spy, although being chased and faced with many hindrances on the way, happens to unravel the counter-espionage in the department.',\n",
       "   \"One of the mainstream reviews quoted on the back cover used the terms  literate and informed , and I find that I find these two adjectives to be very appropriate. When it comes to entertainment literature I can very much appreciate books that expands my knowledge of the English language and also provides somewhat in-depth information about some specialized topic, in what areas really isn't important at all.  Also, this is a very exciting, rapidly flowing spy thriller. The fact that it's almost fifty years old doen't matter much.\"],\n",

       "  'review': [\"Buckley, William F. Stained Glass. Probably more than any other novel, this best illustrates the type of ethics the CIA will use to maintain “security.” From that it is tempting to read the CIA as the hitman for global liberalism. That's certainly true on one level, but the dilemma that Blackford Oakes faces is a real one. The focus point of the story is the heroic and charismatic German noble, Count Axel Wintegrin. Germany is divided between West and East, the latter living under Soviet terror (made possible by the Allies some five years earlier). Wintegrin is a rising politician who campaigns on the promise of unifying Germany by liberating East German from Communist slavery. Of course, every human being should rally to such a cause. NATO, however, is reluctant to support Wintegrin, as they fear such a move would trigger World War III. Wintegrin, however, has anticipated and countered every objection to his plan. He is the only one in the West with the backbone to stand up to the Soviet dragon. Oakes is torn between his desire to help his new friend (and thus liberate millions of people from slavery) and obeying his masters in the CIA. What will Oakes do? The CIA makes it very clear that if Wintegrin starts WWIII, millions would die. The alternative is to dispose of Count Wintegrin and save millions of lives, although leaving millions under socialist slavery. What will Oakes do? Following upon the heels of the events in Saving the Queen, Stained Glass takes us from the countryside of Merry Olde England (albeit in the 1940s) to post-war Germany. The beauty of the German language and its culture (exorcised from Hitlerism) is apparent in this novel and pulls the reader in.\",\n",
       "   \"William F. Buckley Jr. is hailed as one of the top conservative writers of the 20th century. He even wrote some of Reagan's speeches. I've been wanting to read one of his novels for some time, and picked this up at an estate sale for $1 (First edition, too!). This is the first book I've read by him, and frankly I am disappointed with  Stained Glass . I expected this to be a first-rate espionage thriller, along the lines of Bourne Identity or James Bond. Instead this ended up being everything I hate in a book! I couldn't care less for the main character, Blackford Oakes. While he is smart and good looking, he is a hypocrite and a mindless drone. I disapprove of the supporting American CIA and negotiating background characters. They are sleazy, spineless, and will do anything in the name of  peace . I loathe the ending. It counters everything America supposedly stands for. The only redeeming aspect of  Stained Glass  is Axel Wintergrin, and the plot of rebuilding a ruined chapel, St. Anselms.  To play devil's advocate, it should be stated this is the second book in a series, of which I was unaware when I began reading. Perhaps if I had read the first book, I wouldn't dislike Blackford as much. That being said, I'll flush out more below why I don't like him. SPOILERS  - You've been warned In case you are wondering why this book is called  Stained Glass , it's actually the method of how Axel Wintergrin is murdered. He sits down to examine the various shades of stained glass for the chapel, and the apparatus to view the glass is rigged to electrocute him. This irritates me, firstly because they kill the best character is this book and secondly, they take the one source of joy in the book, the rebuilding of a destroyed Medieval chapel, and twist it to nefarious purposes. It is inconceivable to me.  Axel Wintergrin is the only redeeming character in  Stained Glass . He is reasonable, accountable, honest, and is a perfect foil to Hitler. While Wintergrin is seeking to become chancellor of Germany, it's not to unite and imperialize Europe-he merely wants to reestablish the Germany state under one leadership and start a new path for Germany in the modern world.  The fact that America bends to USSR's blackmail is unfathomable to me. Axel is correct in assuming the USSR is all bark and no bite, yet the CIA yields at the slightest challenge. What the actual fuck?! And then to keep claiming that this guy Rufus is the brightest mind who has prevented countless disasters, thinks assassinating Axel is the correct course of action? I don't believe Rufus is intelligent at all. Additionally, it bothers me on a personal level that Blackford can have an American girlfriend yet feel it's okay to sleep with other women. For a man supposedly tortured between his morals and his love of America, he has zero qualms about cheating.\",\n",
       "   \"I'm not usually a reader of spy or suspense type works, so I came across this with low expectations.  It's the only book in the series I've read. So I don't know offhand if I missed anything by not reading the preceding.  For me it got interesting in the last quarter of the book, but the slow build up was tedious for my taste.\",\n",
       "   \"Started slow but got good near the end. Buckley was always a talker, and there is certainly way too much exposition in this novel. But despite the flab the bones are good. I found less silliness than in the previous (first) novel also, which didn't hurt. Because of the public nature of this novel's crisis, it is a bit of alternative history in which Germany might have been reunited much sooner--unless World War III broke out (versus the Soviets, of course). The hero was not as much being, well, heroic as he was maintaining the status quo. But in this ever-shifting world, that itself can be a noble calling.\",\n",
       "   \"I'm old enough to remember a divided Germany and, very dimly, the Berlin Wall. But today's world is rather different, so it is always interesting to read a book written during those decades of a divided Germany and a worldwide struggle between East and West. Stained Glass by William F. Buckley is one such story entrenched in the Cold War. It is full of secret agents, political intrigue and people talking to each other in code. I would compare it to a James Bond movie, except I've never seen a James Bond movie. So I'll say instead that it is almost what I've always expected a James Bond movie to be, only with an American secret agent, and a larger vocabulary (I had to use a dictionary twice to figure out a word, when I don't usually look up new words while reading, but rely on the context to give me the meaning). Blackford Oakes is an American secret agent, and he is sent to West Germany to shadow Count Axel Wintergren, a German who is running for the chancellorship and whose platform consists of one plank: unification of East and West Germany. Because Wintergren threatens violence to achieve his aims, the goverments in Washington and Moscow get nervous. Moscow accuses Washington of supporting Wintergren, while Oakes' superiors in Washington are worried that Wintergren will start a third world war, not 10 years after the conclusion of the second. When Moscow discovers Oakes, it raises a host of questions: is there a Russian agent in Wintergren's entourage? Will that agent try to kill Wintergren? And can Wintergren win the election? Stained Glass was an interesting book and a radical departure from what I usually read. Maybe I'll give another spy-thriller a try. Maybe I'll even try a James Bond novel…\",\n",
       "   \"Of the Oakes stories, I've found this to be one of the  heaviest  in terms of agonizing over the protagonist's dilemma. It is also one of the more deliberately-staged alternate realities or  what if  scenarios, in which a much more compelling movement for German reunification is inserted into the post-war West German federal elections (a more plausible opponent to Adenauer). Still, it is fun, with relief coming in occasional laugh-out-loud moments of WFB's signature devilish humor. As always with Oakes, it is also fun to play  what is real and what is fiction , something that WFB took delightfully beyond today's restraints of  Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead... . Perhaps the most artful part of this novel is detailed description of the restoration of St. Anselm's chapel, a 14th century gothic church on the estate of Count Axel Wintergrin. Wintergrin is the subject of Oakes' mission and the reconstruction, consistent with American aid offered to post-war Germany, is his cover. Yet a fair portion of the novel is devoted to describing the careful and well-executed pursuit of restoring the chapel to its former beauty. The project becomes Oakes' true passion as well as his only escape from the grim turns his official objective takes.\",\n",
       "   \"Summary: When a charismatic German who fought against the Nazis in the resistance in Norway campaigns to become Chancellor on a platform to reunite Germany, Soviets and Americans come together to block this, with Blackford Oakes at the center, restoring a family chapel of the candidate. Count Axel Wintergren participated in the Nazi invasion of Poland, disappearing and turning over Nazi invasion plans to the Poles. For the remainder of the war, he fought with the resistance in Norway, returning to his village and family enclosure after the war. Elections for the Chancellorship in West Germany are coming with Konrad Adenauer the leading candidate. That is until Wintergren. Over the months, he has slowly built a following throughout the country, then announced his candidacy. The country is electrified with this youthful face with a radical idea that captures their hearts: reunite Germany. Outside of Germany no one likes this idea. Not the Soviets whose sphere of influence includes East Germany. Not the Americans who recognize the possibility that World War III could break out with NATO dangerously unprepared and the only deterrent being America's nuclear arsenal. Enter Blackford Oakes, whose engineering skills qualify him to restore the St. Anselm chapel on Wintergren's estate, allowing him to get close to Wintergren, to pass along intelligence, to dissuade…and more? There are two surprises for the Americans. One is that Oakes cover is blown. Chief KBG agent for Europe Boris Bolgin know who he's working on. The other is that the Soviets have their own agent, Erika Chadinoff, working as Wintergren's translator. The bug in Oakes' room at the chateau traces back to her room. All of this brings the Americans and Soviets into a most unlikely alliance. Wintergren must be stopped. When attempts to torpedo his standings in the polls through apparently compromising personal information fail and backfire, they conclude there is only one option left, to eliminate Wintergren. Both Bolgin and his CIA counterpart look to Oakes to do the deed. There is just one problem. Oakes has come to respect and admire Wintergren as one of a kind in his generation. Meanwhile, Wintergren's security man has growing suspicions of Oakes, as does Wintergren's mother. All this with global thermonuclear conflict hanging in the balance. Actually, it doesn't fall to Oakes alone. Erika Chadinoff is in on the alliance. Actually, they had already formed an intimate alliance of sorts, the typical spies in bed trope, despite Blackford's relationship with Sally back home. It almost felt to me a bit obligatory and predictable. Far better, and more consonant with Buckley's values would have been an unconsummated relationship, albeit with some sexual tension thrown in. That would have been more interesting. The shame of this is that it wasn't needed. The build up to the election, the moral dilemma and the international ramifications are plenty to make this an interesting story. The bromance between Wintergren and Oakes is far more riveting than the romance.\",\n",
       "   \"A truly engaging spy novel, which starts of slow but gets better, so if you find the initial parts vexing, hang in there, it gets better. Some excellent  wordsmithy  writing by Buckley. My first Blackford Oakes mystery, will definitely look through the others.  “Parsifal is the opera that begins at five-thirty and when you look at your watch three hours later, it is only five forty-five.”  “Colonel Bolgin, we are here to murder a human being not history.”  He just managed to make the frogs look good while disemboweling them!”  Sarcasm was his crutch, his staff of life, his very best friend, come now, at twilight on execution eve, to his rescue; the first service, at 6:30 a.m., it would perform for its master in a long, long day of servitude.   His dreams were tormenting, confused. He was at Yale, entering an examination room without having read any of the books, but when he reached for them they quicksilvered their way through his fingers. He was in Washington, surreptitiously dropping the addresses of the safe houses to the Soviet ambassador, when a hand clapped him on the shoulder: it was J. Edgar Hoover. He was in Buckingham Palace at a ball when suddenly his trousers slipped down, and he was wearing no underwear. Suddenly he was the Dutch boy back at the dike. He looked down, to find that Holland was being kept from flooding by—a wine bottle pressed into the dike. Now he was taking Holy Orders in a reconstituted chapel at St. Anselm's, and felt peace at last, and slept.  Something I was surprised to read, given Buckley's conservatism, was not the tension in the relationship between Oakes and Erika, which I would say would have been normal, but rather the sexual relationship that is described, albeit mostly veiled wittingly. I think this was unnecessary, and as another reviewer noted, the bromance between Axel and Oakes was more engaging.\",\n",
       "   \"Another great surprise, perhaps as much as the first Blackford Oakes novel. Once again Buckley touches the tropes enough to make me think I know what I'm in for and then surprises me with a poignancy I did not think the novel had earned. Once again as morally complex as Le Carre, perhaps even more so because Buckley has a pragmatic kind of hope even in the midst of his anger--something that many will not share but cannot call naive.\",\n",
       "   'Suppose a very charismatic and very intelligent leader had surfaced in a post-war Germany, with the world still reeling from the horrors of Hitler? Suppose he urged the re-unification of Germany, something forbidden by the treaties? How would the world powers react? How would Blackford Oates react? In Stained Glass he is still a young and idealistic spy and he faces that moral challenge. ',\n",
       "   \"At the time I read these novels (the late 1980's and early 1990's), I found them to be pretty good... sort of a cross between Matt Helm and James Bond. Not quite up to Ian Fleming's standards, but not quite as dated by then either.\",\n",

He breathed with difficulty and suddenly she was Florence Nightengale dressing his wounds...    Does Count Alex Wintergrin live to reunite Germany in 1952? You'll never guess! The best bits involve the reconstruction of a 700 year old chapel, about which both the protagonist Blackford Oakes and his patron Wintergrin are equally passionate.  The ultimate apologetics for killing men wrongly (yet rightly!) in the name of   peace   are pretty gross.\",\n",
       "   \"At first glance this book is simply another good thriller. However, Mr. Buckley offers a subtle view into the 'what if' environment which adds depth to an otherwise common tale. His personal history makes me wonder about the fact-fiction ratio. His knowledge of words exceeds that of most readers so having a dictionary handy is helpful; but I appreciate the challenge. I thoroughly enjoy reading any of his works. On another note, I read a paperback version printed in the vey early 1980s and was surprised to find three obvious tying errors. I find errors very commonplace today but can't believe he or his publishers would accept such imprefections - ever.\",\n",
       "   \"The second Blackford Oakes spy novel, like the fourth ( The Story of Henri Tod ), is set in the divided Germany of the Cold War era, and the shadow of tragedy gives William F. Buckley's storytelling unaccustomed depth and authority. The moral dilemma Oakes faces here is genuinely moving, even if the resolution and the coda (in which Oakes confronts Allen Dulles over the U.S. government's actions) are deeply unsatisfactory. When it came to writing spy novels, Buckley was no Len Deighton, much less John Le Carre, but the Berlin novels show him at his best. \",\n",

This spy thriller drives the reader to ask questions about right and wrong, trust and political disobedience, and so on.

Perhaps I'll pick up some of the others soon. Parents should be aware that there is some violence and sexuality in the novel. Mystery and espionage enthusiasts will certainly enjoy this work.\",\n",
       "   \"I think I like Mr. Oakes better in London than in Germany.

       "  'review': [\"It is a WW II story of survival at sea,against the odds and against the elements.Singapore falls and a group of survivors including soldiers,sailors and nurses try to evade the pursuing Japanese.One of them has the blueprint for a possible Japanese invasion of Australia.  I have mixed feelings about Alistaire McLean.I have enjoyed movies based on his books,including The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare.His books make for entertaining war movies,though the credit for that must go to the film makers as well. But when it comes to his writing style,I'm not a fan.I struggle to finish his books,they tend to drag.He uses far more words than is necessary. South by Java Head was also supposed to become a movie.But after initial plans,the idea was shelved.But as with his other books,this could possibly have transferred well to the big screen.\",\n",
       "   \"An Alistair MacLean story I'd not read previously. Excellent, MacLean at his very best. From the first moment, it was a tense, thrilling adventure; a group of British men and women escaping from Singapore during WWII in the face of the Japanese invasion. Going from threat to threat, displaying understated heroism and growth, the characters are interesting and well-presented. I liked the surprises and twists and ultimately the whole story. Excellent.\",\n",
       "   \"Interesting author, MacLean. He began his career with three WWII novels, the classics  HMS Ulysses  and  Guns of Navarrone , along with the lesser known  South By Java Head . He then switched gears and produced a series of six contemporary (at their time) novels using the sardonic, first person tough-guy style for which he is perhaps best remembered (for better or worse). From there, it was back to the third person for his next four books, all relative classics including the excellent  Ice Station Zebra  and  Where Eagles Dare , along with his only sequel and last World War II story,  Force 10 From Navarone . So  Java Head  is pretty early MacLean, and it shows. I mainly wanted to read this because it is set - or at least starts out (and too quickly leaves) - in Singapore, my current home, and because there is such a dearth of good Singapore war stories (the only other one that comes to mind being  King Rat , James Clavell's first book). But other than that, there isn't a whole lot to particularly recommend this book. It's not at all bad, but it is dated and just not particularly memorable. It's a classic adrift-at-sea story, with some particularly nasty and stereotypical Jap baddies, (MacLean exhibits much of the racial prejudices of the day in his work, and is much kinder to the Germans than he ever was to the Japanese). The basic construct is classic MacLean and similar to his later  Night Without End  (a random group of characters forced together by unusual circumstances - and there's a killer in their midst!), along with some of his typical if confusing good-guy-pretending-to-be-bad-guy-pretending-to-be-good-guy (aka  WTF? ) twists deep in the third act. I've somehow been rereading a lot of MacLean lately - mostly from his  middle period  - and so with no set narrator here it took me a full third of the book to figure out just who the hero was, which was actually kind of nice for a change. MacLean's female characters also tend to be stereotypes - either angels (or fallen angels) with not much to do except act noble or swoon, or older matrons representing the Empire at its best - and his dialogue was always pretty clunky. With his complex plots, a lot of key points end up having to be explained thorugh lengthy bad guy monologuing, or scenes where the soon-to-be-killed good guy asks a lot of questions before he escapes (often thanks to one of those good-guy-pretending-to-be-bad-guy characters).  As a diver, I question a bit of his marine science - folks getting grabbed by giant clams, and barracuda being described as  the most voracious killers in the sea  - but MacLean spent a number of years in the Royal Navy, including the Atlantic and Pacific War theaters, so I imagine he should know what he's talking about; he certainly does know his boats. Interestingly, he helped evacuate liberated POWs from Singapore's infamous Changi Prison after the war, (which was the setting for  King Rat ). Also interestingly, like Joseph Conrad, MacLean learned English as a second language - he grew up speaking Scottish Gaelic!\",\n",
       "   'World War Two adventure in the South seas. I thought this was an OK yarn. I remember I thought some plot elements were unbelievable, the escape from Singapore for example. But generally, nothing much stands out, the sign of a mediocre story.',\n",
       "   \"Its interesting to investigate MacLean's early novels to see the original formulation of all the hackneyed narrative conventions and action-cliches that he came to rely on later in his career. That's the main thing I got out of this novel. MacLean is definitely one of the oddest of the successful thriller writers to come out of WWII. Some of his works ('Guns of Navarone') have themes latent within them which can be raised to greatness. Most of his novels are simply workmanlike, filled technically ingenious heists and commando raids.  This book written in '58--but written with a WWII sensibility. 'Japs' are referred to as 'diabolical devils', 'inhuman fiends', etc. Strange choice of material for MacLean here, in that he uses rather mundane military forces as the antagonists instead of the obviously fictitious and cozily-abstract 'elite, crack, units' he would always invent later.  There are no sophisticated weapons in this novel either; just your standard battle fleets, bayonets, machine-guns, and dive bombers. Its all really rather prosaic. A straightforward war story.  Well, almost. There are inevitably a couple of lurid elements--'secret plans on microfilm' and '100,000 tonnes of secret fuel oil' sought by the minions of the Rising Sun. Really, most of the story is about survival on a crowded life-raft.  But what I was looking for when I picked up the book--fully-fledged characters and realistic dialog--neither was present. They're not present in the later MacLean career... but I was hoping this early writing would not be part of the formula. I was disappointed.  Instead of three-dimensional personalities, there are circus caricatures. Like the Scots Sergeant-Major who can fell anyone with a massive blow from his club-like fist. Like the heroic protagonist who gives speeches while tossing grenades,   its nothing, really, all in a day's work .  And at least two of the shipwreck survivors are secretly saboteurs. Naturally. Eric Ambler does all this so much better. Ambler distracts the reader from the predictable story goal. MacLean doesn't bother. He telegraphs what the 'macguffin' is at the start of his stories. In this case, microfilm.  in 'Jaqva Head' MacLean again is brusquely upfront, informs us (painfully) that the outcome of his plot has a nation teetering on the brink of disaster. Still, he gets away with it. Because he's an action writer; and he has a fabulous dexterity at writing his own particular style of action which no one else wants to do. His style is interchangeable no matter what the title of the books are; its uncanny the way he never switches anything up or tries something new. His male heroes are unique in never needing sleep; possessing fantastic calm even in the wildest chaos; and never questioning themselves no matter what. Its gets very tiring. 'South By Java Head' is cast from the same die as his later line of hits. On its own; nothing very special. A lesser example of his abilities but found quite near the debut of his career. That's what's remarkable.  \",\n",
       "   \"On the night of February 14, 1942, Singapore has been bombed so thoroughly by the Japanese that little survives. More importantly, little in the way of transport out of Singapore—and transport is what Brigadier Farnholme urgently needs, because after many months of trying, Farnholme has finally managed to obtain the detailed plans for the Japanese invasion of Northern Australia. The plans are all encoded, of course, and the only man who can break the code lives across the world, in London. Farnholme  has  to get out of Singapore, to Allied territory, to get the papers to London.  Thus begins  South by Java Head , with Farnholme, in disguise as a drunken old sot trying to escape with a Gladstone bag full of industrial diamonds. Aboard a former slaving vessel, with a very shady captain and crew, he finds himself with other wounded, shell-shocked or just plain lost people, the lovely Eurasian nurse Gudrun Drachmann and the two-year old orphan Peter among them. And when the boat is bombed and sunk, its survivors rescued by an oil tanker, the tanker's first officer, John Nicolson, soon becomes a pivotal figure in the entire adventure… And adventure it is, in classic MacLean style. With many twists, with sudden disasters following on the heels of triumph, with people switching sides, with surprises round every bend. There's a romance (restrained and believable) thrown in, and there's a fair share of everything from breathtaking bravery to sheer save-your-own-hide selfishness. Combined with that are amazing real descriptions of the sea, of marine warfare: not as brilliantly memorable as in MacLean's masterpiece  HMS Ulysses , but still excellent.  The one thing that jarred was the distinctly racist tone when it came to the Japanese—the  'yellow devils' , as they're referred to repeatedly. The Japanese characters in  South by Java Head  are uniformly evil, brutal, ' with porcine eyes' , and barbaric when it comes to dealing with enemies. Yes, I understand that MacLean is not only writing from the point of view of the Allies, but also as a man who himself fought in the war; but this is caricaturing of a race in a blindly generalized way. (It's telling that— spoiler ahead —the sole German, a soldier at that and obviously an ally of the Japanese, eventually lets his better side triumph).\",\n",
       "   \"I read this book because a MacLean fan of my acquaintance insisted that the literary hell I was put through by  Where Eagles Dare  was a fluke, and that his other books were better. Big mistake. This one is worse.  MacLean has an infuriating habit of writing military commanders who perpetually endanger their soldiers, their missions, and other innocents through an inexplicable refusal to kill enemy combatants. In  Where Eagles Dare,  the supposedly heroic mission leader makes a ridiculous and irrelevant effort to arrest a pair of Nazis in Germany during wartime and bring them home to face a trial--yes, a  trial --instead of just  shooting the stinking Nazis  like any good soldier would do. The eventual result is that the Nazis die anyway, but not before they make corpses out of most of his soldiers. So: no trial, and a whole lot of Allied families are needlessly bereaved because of our hero.   South by Java Head  turns out to be no different. In this case, a captain must shepherd a stricken and parched lifeboat full of wounded survivors through Japanese-infested waters to reach safety in Australia. And just to spice things up, guess what additional passengers the captain thinks it's vitally important to bring back on his boat: a full crew of pirates! Why? To stand trial, of course! If you know MacLean, then the result is predictable: there's no trial, because the pirates wind up dead en route, but only after taking a bunch of innocents with them.  I console myself by picturing MacLean proudly and dramatically explaining to the bereaved families the senseless vanity that their sons and husbands were sacrificed to, and then those families beating the stuffing out of him.  (Incidentally, after a while it becomes almost comical the way MacLean seems unable to describe Japanese people without throwing in the adjectives  leering  and  yellow. )  This is, I swear on all that is sacred, the last MacLean I'll ever read. I don't care if it turns out he ghost-wrote Harry Potter; I'm done with him. (Related: Hey Goodreads! How come I can't give less than one star?)\",\n",
       "   \"Filled with purple prose, cliched feelings, and static characters,  South By Java Head  nevertheless is meticulously plotted and overflowing with over the top action scenes. It is everything a teenage boy or an undiscriminating adult male reader would enjoy back in the 1950s and early 1960s. And that is not so much of a put down as one might think. I doubt the same target audience today could deal with the book. They haven't the concentration, the vocabulary, or patience to deal with much of the nautical and geographic terms that would undoubtedly overwhelm them. Not so back during the days of the book's launch. The target audience for mass paperback adventure stories was not only larger than today but more intelligent. Another fault? There is the feel occasionally that  South By Java Head  veers close to being a romance novel. Especially during the last two or three chapters I almost expected it to resort to the language of a bodice ripper. At times it seems a cross between John Carter of Mars and a Barbara Cartland novel. So why read this book? It does become tiresome at points and the characters never exhibit the slightest indication of growth. They are just the same at the end as at the beginning, expressing noble values, justice, and fair play. But then there are those action passages. Pretty good. No wonder Alistair MacLean did so well when translated to film. And there is another reason. Written in 1957, this novel about World War II, the Fall of Singapore, and a motley group of survivors who survive torpedo attacks, starvation at sea, and chases through jungles actually works at another level. It's a Cold War novel. It's not just the British against the Japanese. It's the Western world against an inhuman Oriental totalitarian ideology. Without spoiling the plot, just let it be said that White Europeans come together to see their common heritage under assault from a bloodthirsty foe who morally is somewhere between Ming the Merciless and Mao Zedong.\",\n",
       "   \"[SPOILER ALERT] I judge a book largely by the ending; this one ends badly--so it's not among my favorite MacLean stories. But it has one quote I quite like:    Foster always said that education was very important, but that it didn't really matter, because intelligence was more important than that, and that even intelligence didn't count for so much, that wisdom was far more important still. He said he had no idea in the world whether you had education or intelligence or wisdom and that it couldn't matter less, a blind man could see that you had a good heart, and the good heart was all that mattered in this world.

       "   \"Saw this book on the library shelf, and was overcome by a wave of nostalgia!! Remembered reading these books during my schooldays, and giving them more attention than my school books! MacLean didn't disappoint, and I ended up sitting up late into the night finishing the book in one sitting!! He is truly the master of this genre. I don't know if it is nostalgia or the style of writing, but later year thrillers like the Ludlum's and the Wilbur Smith's just don't have the same effect.\",\n",
       "   \"Although I've seen the films made from several of Maclean's books, I don't think I'd ever read anything by him until this one. Published in 1958, it very much feels like an adventure thriller of its era. The book opens in Singapore as Japanese troops are about to overrun it in 1942. We quickly meet a variety of people who've made their way to the docks, seeking to escape -- alas, every ship has sailed. Among the group are an elderly Brigadier who is quickly revealed to be carrying secret plans vital to the war effort that must make it to Allied hands, a group of local nurses, an orphaned two-year old, and a group of wounded British soldiers led by a Scottish corporal. Soon enough they are extracted by a mysterious Dutchman and a crew of cutthroats, and not too long after that, they are all picked up by a British merchant marine oil tanker. From then on out, it's one narrow escape after another as they dodge Japanese planes, ships, and submarines, trying desperately to make it to Allied lands. However there's more than a bit of the Agatha Christie mystery to it all, with colorful characters all trapped together, some who might not be whom they appear to be, secret motives, etc... None of the characters have any depth or dimension to them, but are mainly constructed to serve the adventure's plot.  It's reasonably page-turning stuff, albeit fairly uneven in tone and pacing at times. The opening in Singapore is a deeply immersive slow burn, while the action on the high seas is hectic but exciting, and the climactic chapters feel rushed and overexcited. It won't help the modern reader that the Japanese villains are universally depicted as cruel savage brutes, and their commander is a master of torture. It's all a bit cartoonish and rushed at the end, which is a shame, because most of the book -- as over-the-top as it is, is fun. Recommended to those who like rip-roaring WWII adventure tales, especially nautical ones.\",\n",
       "   \"A standard MacLean novel with the usual twists and turns in the plot. Not one of MacLean's best readable enough.  The book tempted me because it was set in Singapore during the period of the Japanese invasion in World War Two. I believed it might give some flavor of Singapore and Southeast Asia during the period. Well, it didn't because the plot was very much a MacLean plot with action, intrigue and a little bit of history thrown in for good measure.  Recommended for MacLean fans or if you've nothing better to do. The author does have many better titles for those wishing to taste his style of prose. And it is wordy so keep a disctionary handy! \",\n",
       "   \"This story of action, suspense and survival by the master of the genre didn't disappoint me, for most part, incomprehensible nautical terms and a seemingly hurried ending apart...\",\n",
       "   \"The thing about Maclean's books are that the action starts right from the word go. And there isn't a dull moment throughout. And then there are his heroes - he develops their character so strongly, they're not invincible but smart, valorous and with impeccable character. In this book, it is Nicholson, second in command of Viroma, a British merchant ship. While he is only a merchant sailor, the courage he displays is superhuman. There is the pathos and raw cruelty of war. There's also a beautiful yet muted romance between Nicholson and Gudrun, a nurse. All this is the backdrop, and the plot revolves around a bunch of people who set sail from Singapore, and their unspeakable misery, as they sail in the most difficult conditions to escape the cruel Japanese forces. I'm reducing one point as I found the ending somewhat abrupt and unconvincing.\",\n",
       "   \"I've a liking for history and I possess a particular interest in gathering information about the two world wars. When I wanted to read works of fiction on the world wars, I was immediately redirected to Alistair MacLean. I picked South by Java Head since my knowledge on the Pacific War isn't all that high (The edition I purchased was also rather inexpensive). Coming to the plot, retired Brigadier Foster Farnholme is at Singapore and he is desperate to leave. The reason being, he has the complete plans for the Japanese invasion of Australia and wants to hand it over to the Australians. Unfortunately, the situation isn't favourable to him, the Japanese troops are all over Singapore and the British forces were all set to surrender on the next day. Farnholme along with some people leave Singapore and after a chain of events in the sea, they end up in a British - Arabian tanker Viroma led by Captain Findhorn and his trusted subordinate John Nicolson. But, they know that they aren't going to be out there for too long and the Japanese may attack them any time. The plot is centred on John Nicolson along with a romantic sub-plot between Nicolson and a nurse. When I was suggested Alistair MacLean, I was told to expect a thrilling adventure, an element of suspense, traitors and double-agents and of course, protagonists surviving beating all the odds. South by Java Head fulfils all these, including the last one. It had a brilliant adventure, desperate people trying to reach Australia by sea from Singapore. An element of suspense - when the Japanese are going to attack and how this little crew is going to cope up with it. Protagonists surviving beating all the odds - I'm not willing to make this a spoiler. Definitely, you'd also be made to guess who is going to be the traitor, there might be one or more.  But, the book certainly also has several drawbacks. Alistair MacLean might be well known for anything else, but certainly not for his language, with most of the dialogues being flat and boring and also had occasional grammatical errors. I also didn't like the way the author portrayed the Japanese, as heartless killing machines and frequently referring to them as “those inhuman devils”. Besides, people who aren't familiar with maritime terms would find it difficult to understand the navy jargons. Moreover, the end to the sup-plot was also quite abrupt, as though the author used it only to lighten the entire plot and had no intentions of giving it a proper finish. There were also several loose ends, such as; it was never mentioned why Farnholme had a liking for the two year old boy and why he had to arrange such a dangerous trip for him.  However, the bottom-line is, whether the reader contemplates if the occurrences are possible in a real situation or not, the reader would certainly enjoy reading this book. This book is highly recommended to those who are in the same “boat” as I am in terms of interests. I'm willing to give this book a three out of five, because of the excessive number of negatives\",\n",

       "   \"Library ebook (a reminder for me of the story in brief) Checked Singapore WII invasion Wikipeada and it was in the month of February 1942 and the article portrays the Japanese army in Singapore and Malaysia were extremely brutal. As to how many Japanese actually followed this horrific course is not clear and of course atrocities imprint themselves in the mind and hearts of the people and history itself. February, 1942: Singapore lies burning and shattered, defenceless before the conquering hordes of the Japanese Army, as the last boat slips out of the harbour into the South China Sea. On board are a desperate group of people, some with a secret to guard, some willing to kill to keep that secret safe. The boat owner, Siran definitely was treacherous, ruthless, a black marketeer and a slave trader amoung other things. And when his ship was bombed, already he had locked in many of the passangers for future slave trading. He left his own ship and the passengers still locked in and umable to get out.  Dutch planter, Van Effen, who turned out to be a german spy named Von something was after two things diamonds(worth 2m something and a Japanese invasion plan of Australia with photos that he knew the Englishman, Farnholme had on him.

Only one thing is certain: the rotting tramp steamer is a floating death trap, carrying a cargo of human TNT. Dawn sees them far out to sea but with the first murderous dive bombers already aimed at their ship. Thus begins an ordeal few are to survive, a nightmare succession of disasters wrought by the hell-bent Japanese, the unrelenting tropical sun and by the survivors themselves, whose hatred and bitterness divides them one against the other.\",\n",
       "   \"I first read this more than 30 years ago as a teenager and enjoyed it as much as - if not more than - I did back then, possibly because I have a greater understanding of the war in the Pacific now. But I hasten to add that that's not a requirement for the book; it just puts it more into context. The narrative whistles along at a cracking pace yet there is no skimping on the descriptions of various action sequences, particularly on the sea-bound elements where MacLean is at his best (no surprise there, him being a Navy man in the war). The only slight let-down, I feel, is that the end feels rushed. It's exciting, that's for sure, but lacking the level of detail of the earlier sections and that leaves a modicum of disappointment at what might have been - hence dropping a star (if I could have done just half a star, I would have). Some of the language is a little outdated by today's standards but you have to remember when the book was written (1958) and allow for that. These last two things aside, it is a great read and thoroughly recommended.\",\n",
       "   \"This is my 2nd time (at least) reading this novel. I first read it in the '70s when I was devouring all of  Alistair MacLean's books as he wrote them but then realized there were older books I'd missed. This is one of his very early novels set around WW2 in the sea off China and Japan. The crew and passengers think that escaping the Japanese is their worst problem but, as in true-MacLean style, their problems are never ending. My rating fifty years ago was 5-star without a doubt but, as I have aged (and possibly my reading tastes have matured a tad??), I find that it is very unusual for me to give a 5 star to many books unless I feel they are exceptional, which I can't say this one was for me. However, I enjoyed the book, liked the characters, loved the fast pace and excitement of trying to decide who the 'baddies' would be so overall, I still felt it was a good read and, given that it was published 64 years ago, I thnk it's great that it has stood the test of time. \",\n",
       "   \"I looked forward to reading my first Alister MacLean novel and early in the book was not disappointed. The book was cleverly set up and introduced. It is a World War II novel that begins with an escape from a ravaged and burning Singapore by boat with an agent and an unusual cast of characters that are carrying the plans for Japan's invasion of Australia. It goes downhill from there. Surving hurricanes, bombings, being picked up by an oil tanker, then attacked by a submarine, then a fake U.S. PT Boat, rowing to Java where they are finally captured by the Japanese, only to escape. There was so much action that it became boring. The only part that was missing was when the safe fell out of the sky on Wiley Coyote's head. \",\n",
       "   'Well, it was a very good read in many ways. Parts were a bit too one sided, but historically it was very interesting. One, the attitudes about the Japanese were so hard and hateful at that time. Two, the typical old female roles were stronger than now. And, three, the nautical terms were very interesting and new to me. Terms like Baft, or into the bows of the boat, and many more. I meant to look them up even though I knew the jist of them, mostly. Oh, and as so many other authors do, the hero is so much better than anyone else - does no wrong and can continue even though severely injured, etc. But overall I liked it and will continue to read his other books. ',\n",
       "   \"This was a good MacLean adventure story like the others I've read, but I knocked it down from four stars to three mainly due to the last quarter or so of the story. The Japanese and German officers were burdened with awful, schmaltzy dialogue and the need to tell the hero the entirety of their past and future, like the villains in a bad cartoon. That made it seem like an old Hollywood b-movie, but otherwise I thought it was a good yarn.\",\n",
       "   'This was an interesting book. The premise is that a British operative has mysteriously got his hands on encoded Japanese plans for an invasion of Australia in WWII. The operative is trying to get the plans out of hostile territory and into the hands of the allies, where they can be of use. Highly episodic in nature with several good plot twists, but the ending felt quite abrupt.',\n",

Thank you, Mr. Henshaw for providing an entertaining read without offending those sensibilities. Aside from the over-use of acronyms (which is probably an occupational hazard given Mr. Henshaw's background) I was surprised this was a first novel. The characters were pretty interesting, although at times I found myself thinking they were taking a back-seat to the plot. The plot kept my interest enough to keep reading to see all the pieces come together for a satisfying conclusion. And... the door was left ajar (not quite wide open) for a sequel. Which I will read when/if it is published.  Several times I noted page numbers so I could go back and re-read the little aphorism gems I found. I even read a few aloud to my husband. I liked the patriotism that was evident in the pages of this book. I expect to see Mr. Henshaw's writing evolve as he hones his trade. And I wish him luck. I enjoyed this book.\",\n",

Problem with it however is that since it's been done so many times, authors have to work hard at coming up with new methods in order to differentiate themselves from others. In  Red Cell  the first book in the Kyra Stryker series, a former CIA analyst uses his experience to portray a realistic worst case scenario and what the PRC would have to do if it wished to conduct a  rough wooing  for Taiwan. Now to the review. How far would Asia's most powerful nation go to get what it believes it's historically entitled too?  The book begins on a miserable night in Caracas, Venezuela. Case officer Kyra Stryker has been press-ganged into conducting a rendezvous with an asset who has the station chief hook, line and sinker. Despite protesting about how it's too good to be true and breaks every rule of tradecraft, her idiot boss says otherwise. She's proven right as some gentlemen from SEBIN try get the jump on her when she holds back to draw them out. Surviving and returning to Langley, she's met by the DCI who takes pity on her but decides to reassign her to  Red Cell , a think-tank which the company uses to predict asymmetric threats. She meets Jonathan Burke, the man who runs Red Cell and slowly gets used to her new work. Meanwhile in Beijing, a series of events begin to suggest something big. The Ministry Of State Security suddenly intensifies its activities, a address by the Chinese Premier has hostile overtones and the top asset run by the company suspects he's been rumbled and requests extraction. All these threads come together in duel for supremacy in East Asia.  In terms of plot,  Red Cell  is excellent. I recently read a book which was claimed to be written by  the next Tom Clancy  but read like the script of a Roger Moore James Bond film. Mr Henshaw in contrast really does look like he could be the next Clancy. His narrative is well researched and manages to explain geopolitics and other technical details (what Case officers actually do and the work done by the Science Technology Directorate) accurately, without being overbearing and his writing style is crisp and is paced nicely. Plot twists are also excellent. From a run through the narrow apartment blocks of Beijing to a epic air duel over the Taiwan strait, the action is well executed like a seasoned pro, and his astoundingly good for a first book.  Characters? So many standouts. But I'll focus on three.  Kyra Stryker. There haven't been many strong fictional characters in the post 9/11 spy thriller genre until recently. A CIA case officer, she's not one of the assassins/soldiers who run around blowing away threats to freedom and democracy. But she is just as badass as them in her own way. Despite this only being the early stage of her career, she's cool under pressure, does not panic or have an emotional breakdown like female characters of the past (although she does make one error she shouldn't have in the book) and is competent at her job, namely gathering intelligence in hostile environments. Mr Henshaw did well with her characterization. You will come to like her as she survives through her wits rather than a gun as she does fieldwork. In her partnership with Mr Burke, she's the muscle while he's the brains. Speaking of Mr Burke, he's also a good character. While he gets the opportunity to avoid fieldwork (although in book 2, he takes a bigger role) he was characterized well done but not quite as developed as his partner.  Then, there's the DCI Cooke. In the vein of Vince Flynn's Irene Kennedy, she's basically the dream boss most intelligence officers would hope to work for. Competent, not a micro-manager and when it comes to inter-service rivalry, she does the smart thing and let her man opponent make the first mistake.  Overall, Red Cell is a solid first novel. The scenario it uses has forced me to take off one star (been done to death so many times), but it is a well executed, realistic, spy thriller. It reads like Tom Clancy in the days before his books turned into paperback bricks. Great pacing, excellent characterization, insider technical details which don't take over the narrative and a relevant issue at the heart of the book. What more can you ask for?  QUITE RECOMMENDED. \",\n",
       "   \"This was one of the best spy thrillers I've read so far. The author drops you right in the middle of the first assigment of the main character, and introduces her in a very good way. From the first page it got me hooked. The story moves at the right pace, which I believe is very important for a spy thriller to be gripping. The action sequences were very well written, and I could feel the tension and pressure they're under during those scenes.  There were only two things bothering me. First, was the use of many (technical) abbrevations, it sometimes made the story a bit hard to follow for me. Secondly, the author writes the story from too many POV's. I'm aware that spy thrillers are usually plotdriven stories, and therefore are written from more POV's than just the main characters but personally I felt the author used too many (important: I do have to mention that the characters from which the POV's were written do come together during the climax at the end of the story).  In all, this book was very enjoyable and felt realistic, and I hope to read more books by this author in the future. \",\n",
       "   'RED CELL Mark Henshaw If you like stories of our intelligence service and its possible interaction with the intelligence agencies of other countries, in this case, China and Taiwan, you will enjoy Red Cell. The suspense is somewhat uneven, going from a tense walk into a trap and a run for her life, to the several pages of unnecessary detailed explanation. At the heart of the novel is a possible war with China, and how the intelligence communities, despite their shortcomings, save us. Since this is not straightforward, there are references to other countries with unfriendly countries. Lockheed Martin is mentioned often too. As a previous CIA agent himself, Henshaw adds a lot of details he thinks the reader needs, but the story would have been more exciting without the details and more emphasis on action. The characters are not developed enough to feel real or sympathetic. This is a debut, and Henshaw will no doubt strengthen his weak spots and get better with practice.',\n",
       "   \"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Henshaw's Cold Shot which is the follow up in this series of spy novels featuring Kyra Stryker & Jonathan Burke I went back for the series opening book. I'm not sorry for the experience but was mostly underwhelmed. Those who enjoy Tom Clancy styled highly technical spy novels will enjoy it but I found some portions much of a snooze. Cold shot was much more of an action oriented thriller.\",\n",
       "   '3.75 Stars, I like these Kyra Stryker books.',\n",
       "   \"Mark Henshaw uniquely melds the detail-driven aspects of spy tradecraft with spine-rattling battle action and technical warfare in his debut thriller  Red Cell.  Although the book follows the oft-used Clancy paradigm of mixing clandestine tactics with a little military might, Henshaw lends a credibility not usually observed in this genre -- perhaps due to his insider background as a CIA analyst, or perhaps because he carefully avoids the political tropes and military-bent narrative styles that besiege his spy-thriller-writing forebears. Instead, Henshaw's voice sounds authentic and reasonable, not preachy, boastful or overly masculine. In fact, he draws on his authenticity to create believable, likable dual protagonists in Kyra Stryker and Jonathan Burke. Both CIA employees have fallen out of favor with their agency and must put past mistakes, predilections and biases aside in working together to exfiltrate a valuable and loyal asset from the treacherous Beijing streets.  Not everything gets magically resolved by the end of this one, which typically would be a detriment in a novel, but in this case works to stoke the reader's yearning to continue with the series. Stryker and Burke's characterizations are rendered so vividly and without bias that it only seems fitting and real for each to have some unresolved demons. For example, will Stryker subsume into alcoholism -- certainly not an ideal trait for a CIA operative, and a personality underpinning which Henshaw alludes to but skillfully keeps at the margins of this debut novel. Similarly, will Burke's apathy and sometimes overt antipathy toward bureaucracy, even the organization he works for, torpedo his career as a skilled analyst? The dye is expertly cast by Henshaw, but the reader can leave this one after 326 pages feeling that he will auspiciously deliver compelling answers in future installments. In the meantime, simply enjoy this thrill ride. Several of the spy-driven parts become so pulse-pounding with suspense you may need to take your blood pressure medicine -- or something to calm your nerves. Henshaw renders these moments in minute-by-minute cinematic detail. The battle scenes at the book's culmination feel ratcheted up to just the right intensity -- though the author may lose readers in some places by not fully explaining weapons terminology or military jargon. Acronyms went undefined in several places. Despite those minor drawbacks,  Red Cell  has plenty on which it could boast: a compelling narrative, characters who drew the reader's curiosity and empathy, and a clearly focused flow where even non-action sequences carry a dramatic, almost cinematic, air. Henshaw could boast about this work, but after consuming it, the reader may feel that Henshaw would choose no such aggrandizement. This book can rest on its merits alone and needs no vociferous platitudes, nor will the series need to bill itself as offering high-stakes action.  The understated qualities are what separate this book (and hopefully series) from the rest of the genre.\",\n",
       "   \"Really good book, greatly enhanced by the solid ring of authenticity throughout. Henshaw is no ex-insurance agent like Tom Clancy; he's a genuine CIA analyst who not only knows his own business but also has a solid understanding of the ops/tradecraft side of the house, (the only false notes being an unnecessary back alley fight in Beijing that would be a career-ender for any real case officer; and a final action scene that, while very well written, I'm pretty sure would have let to full scale war). And always nice to see these sort of international thrillers set in Asia rather than Europe (so '60s) or the Middle East (so '90s - 10s). If you take this story (published in 2012, but probably written at least 1-2 years early) and move it from the Taiwan Straits to the South China Sea, it would be even more relevant to one of the world's top hotspots today. HOWEVER:  PLEASE READ THE BOOK - DO  NOT  LISTEN TO THE AUDIO VERSION! I started on the audiobook, but it was so bad on so many levels that I had to stop after two CDs and switch to the book.  For ANY readers:  narrator Rob Patterson makes no effort to distinguish between any of the many characters - a cardinal sin for  any   narrator - and his overall phrasing is awkward and off-putting.  For readers of spy novels:  the narrator consistently and annoyingly spells out many of the acronyms that are commonly pronounced as words - SIGINT, STU, NIACT, SPO. And most grating of all,  for any speakers of even basic Chinese:   Patterson has NO idea how to pronounce Chinese - he mangles the most common Chinese names and places, and slaughters entire sentences of jumbled nonsense; just  unlistenable . And so I didn't. (Meanwhile, the book actually does a fine job with almost all of the Chinese, having just a few misspellings -  Shoudou  instead of  Shoudu,  etc - and [a personal pet peeve] improperly split words, like  Yuem-ing  instead of  Yue-ming .)\",\n",
       "   \"Really pretty good once I ditched the audiobook and ran for the library copy. Quite technically adept, though honestly I only know from reading, so I could be wrong. I felt good in the hands of these two characters, despite the fact that they were not admired by their people they worked with in most instances. It was also a tiny bit unrealistic to find someone directly out of Camp Peary (the farm) being so well known to the Director of the CIA, let alone admired by. However, the fictional Director seemed realistic and also is a woman. Thanks, Mark Henshaw -- it is possible, in both real life and fiction! Other than a few things that seemed unlikely (but that's the reason to read thrillers rather than historical reports,) I found myself not exasperated by unlikely romance or stupidity in large quantities -- two things that have ruined a surprisingly large number of spy novels for me. I was pleased with the setting and the characters and the story. Can it be possible? A series of spy novels I might be able to read? I'm going to test this theory by reading the next one. It's been said by at least one other person that I know of, but the audio could not be worse. I've heard a fair number of bad audio narrators, and this is certainly one of them. Happily, it seems that someone else narrates the rest of them, so we'll see about the next reader. \",\n",
       "   \"I 'discovered' Mark Henshaw with his 'Fall of Moscow Station' novel, which was actually his third in the 'Red Cell' CIA series. That one was pretty good and I liked his approach and subject matter, so I thought I'd cycle back and begin at the beginning. Glad I did! I loved 'Red Cell', his first in the series. The writing is decent, which was my only quibble with this book, but the plot was great, the pace was intense, and the characters on their way to being well-developed and very likable. The action sequences, particularly those in the conclusion, were exciting and extremely realistic. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of tradecraft as well as the reasoning used by the CIA personnel to interpret past events and predict future ones.  The plot was tricky and involved the triangular relationship between China, Taiwan, and the US. An incident occurs on Taiwan, China decides to use it to escalate tensions, and the US needs to figure out what's going on and make the right choices. Without going into detail, it's quite believable. If you're into 'spy novels and thrillers', this is a good one..... highly recommended! \",\n",

       "   \"Having a little background in HUMINT—human intelligence—I enjoy reading espionage novels, and having spent 20 years in the Army, I also love military fiction. Mark Henshaw, a former CIA analyst, brilliantly combined both genres in his first thriller, Red Cell. I wouldn't have thought that an analyst would be as up as he is on tradecraft—clandestine HUMINT operational techniques, such as secret writing, brush contacts, and dead drops. The novel, concerning a brewing conflict based on China's desire to reunify Taiwan and the need for a Chinese source to obtain critical information to prevent a major war, doesn't hit a single false note and is a real page-turner. I can't think of a better thriller that I have read for several years. An easy five of five stars.\",\n",
       "   \"This was a great novel about espionage, the CIA, military confict, and political strife. I really enjoyed the realism and descriptions and could tell that the author had spent a number of years working for the CIA. An added bonus was the lack of profanity, something most other contemporary authors writing in this genre can't seem to live without.  My one gripe regarding this novel was the lack of fleshed out characters. I would have liked a bit more character depth and description. That said, I will definitely be on the lookout for more novels from Mark Henshaw. If your are looking for a good contemporary spy/military novel, I recommend giving this book a try. \",\n",
       "   'Very good CIA/military thriller. Not very gory, good plot and characterization, and a fun analysis of Chinese-American relations.',\n",
       "   'There was a lot of technical jargon and not enough spy story, character development and coherence. ',\n",
       "   \"I am happy that Mark stuck with it and achieved his goal of writing novels. I'm glad I acquired and read his debut novel. I liked it and plan to read his other novels. Red Cell is a strong debut work that stands out in a genre typically cluttered with cookie-cutter plots and filled with excessive vulgarities and sex. Mark's debut novel departs from that stale formula with good storytelling, clean language, and engaging action scenes not needing gory details to paint the picture. As a former CIA analyst, the author uses his experiences to add a base level of authenticity to his depictions of fictional Agency reports and daily briefs for senior leaders. Of course, he couldn't be TOO realistic in his portrayals, and I thought he struck a good balance between reality and creative license. The plot for this novel focuses on US relations with China, particularly escalations and armed conflict over Taiwan, and China's increasing desire to match or surpass the USA in global superpower status. Like any book in the Tom Clancy-style, people in military, intel, and law enforcement professions will find elements to quibble over in this book, or some explanations that may intentionally be oversimplified to avoid sensitive details, or to keep the story flow moving along without bogging down in unnecessary minutiae. The key here is that the author presents a plausible story based on geopolitical and military realities that are just as relevant in 2020 as they were when published in 2012.  This is a good start to a 3-book series. I look forward to getting book 2.\",\n",
       "   \"Red Cell is as much an espionage as a military-political thriller which offers a good insight into the world of contemporary intelligence. Fans of spy stories get mainly exposed to the heroic times of cold war espionage, while only a few books focus on current reality (David Ignatius is probably the best in this area); Red Cell offers a very interesting deep-dive in modern times CIA, a gigantic, bureaucratic monster where the tension between the  operatives , the case officers and clandestine agents doing the  real work  on the field, and the  analysts , pen pushers devoted to produce tons of reports, is well described here. The author is a former analyst and we all know analysts love details: it takes 8 pages to describe the protagonist running away from a trap-meeting with a double agent; it takes 3 pages to describe how the same protagonist enters the CIA office buildings, how she shows her badge to the guards, how she parks her car, etc....you got the idea, right. The prose as well is as dry as an analyst report, and the story u folds in a pretty linear way, without many twist and turns. Having stipulated this, I must recognise the book gets better as it goes, the second half is better than the first one and the last part really picks up with a good pace; so, to be fair, being this is a debut novel, it's not bad at all.\",\n",
       "   \"Like TV's 24, this book provides an exciting day-by-day account of US espionage and military activity during a three week crisis caused by China's invasion of Taiwan. The main characters, Kyra and Jonathan, are  Red Cell  analysts in the CIA, and are asked to provide out-of-the box ideas, but only are the focus for half of the book. The narration switches among a handful of characters. This is a plot-driven novel; the characters serve their roles, but don't really reach three dimensions. Nevertheless, the spycraft - from the head of the CIA to the ground level - is realistic and totally plausible. The military story - as the US Navy faces off the Chinese Air Force - shows the writer's expertise in this area. The political figures are like those from  West Wing , (nearly) all honorable and uninterested in polls are the politcal after-effects of their decisions. The dialogue is good, with a little humor, and the prose contains the right amount of detail about weapons and military boats and planes. This book was clearly written by someone who knows his stuff, and wants to share some of his considerable experience.\",\n",
       "   \"The author is an alumnus of the CIA Red Cell. My only real criticism is the light-weigh treatment he gives Red Cell analysis. That sort of creative cooperative cognitive brain work is far too   inside baseball  and about as dramatic as sitting in the rush hour traffic, queuing up to get into CIA's Langley campus. Henshaw is right to spend much more ink on CIA clandestine operations, and even after endless Borne movies, adds some nice drama, novelty, and tension. He even shows us some counter-surveillance magic tricks ala  Argo.  It all comes down to getting the lowdown on a super secret Chinese game-changer--the Assassin's Mace--a hunt very familiar to real China-watchers. Like a good Clancy thriller, Henshaw gets his mil-spy-tech pretty accurate. I hope the real U.S. Navy fares as well as they do on Henshaw's pages. Real spooks are serious students of personality and character. Henshaw does okay for a first novel, but needs to spend more time thickening up the people files. His plot and counter-plots portfolio is dead on. But you expect that from a good Red Cell.\",\n",
       "   \"I had great hopes for this having read other reviews but sadly I have given up just short of 50% through. It's not the writing, even though there are plenty of warnings in here about the numerous acronyms. The development of the characters seemed to be going well and I was interested in them but the plot was too segmented for my liking. I can follow a complex plot and that's part of the enjoyment of the spy type thrillers but here we seem to jump about from China to the Taiwan, the USA, to agents on the ground and the research analysts but at 50% through I was thinking we've seen a lot of research and background here but no real progress in the story.  I think the characters may be worth a second shot and at some time I may try book 2 to see how they get on, but the comparisons to Daniel Silva are misplaced, he writes novels with lots of background but the plot moves at a pace to keep you turning the page. No more of this series for me at the moment.\",\n",

It also has a great heroine, who's fearless, and a lot of brainy people. That said, it can bog down at times in abstruse discussions of the pros and cons of this versus that kind of jet plane (a little like  Tom Clancy ).

One line (among many) that I could absolutely identify with, “These politicians would run over their mothers to get in front of a camera, and we have to trust them to make decisions about whether our assets live or die?” I witness that on TV every day, not necessarily about assets, but about their constituents and fellow Americans.

       "  'review': [\"While I like the Bourne series I have to confess the character is beginning to wear thin on me. Wear thin in that he's becoming two deminsional. He travels all over the world. He speaks every language known to man. He wins all his fights. And he absorbs more punishment that a krypton-clad Superman---and still keeps on ticking like a Timex!! How about less mindless action and more story? More suspense. A real puzzler to win with sudden jabbing nightmarish flashes of searing action interspersed within the read? THAT would be refreshing!\",\n",
       "   \"This action-packed thriller is the latest in the popular series starring Jason Bourne, a black ops agent whose identity as a spy has obliterated his recollection of who he really is. This is the tenth book in the series; the first three were written by Robert Ludlum himself before his death in 2001. Jason Bourne has enemies not just because of his position in world of spies, counter-spies and international crime, but personal ones. Throughout the years he has made enemies in every aspect of criminal and terrorist underworlds in a long list of nations around the world. The “myth” of Jason Bourne -- a ruthless agent who will kill anyone to accomplish his goals, is a creation of a top secret agency of US Special Forces.  The Bourne Imperative begins when Jason Bourne fishes a man, half-frozen, out of a lake in Sweden. The man initially suffers from amnesia, but as he regains his memory, it is clear that he has been sent by his superiors against Bourne. The action moves from Sweden to the Middle East to Gibraltar and Paris and to the US and Mexico and back again, as the threads of action-packed narrative move toward a conclusion that can only result in someone's death. The crux of the matter may be $30 million destined for a drug cartel in Mexico, or is that only part of the problem?  An arm of the CIA called Treadstone, designed to carry out dangerous and top secret operations, maintains a network of agents who ostensibly work for the same goals as Bourne, but both loyalties and resentments that go back many years often obscure their motivations. Bourne's world is one where anything can be done, if you are unscrupulous enough and know the right people. The unrelenting action in the novel clearly show how this series has become so popular both in print and on the screen.  (Review published in Suspense Magazine)\",\n",
       "   \"Like lots of people, I've long been a fan of the Jason Bourne series. And when Mr. Ludlum died, I thought we had lost a fine novelist. His vocabulary was impressive. Van Lustbader has never been my favorite author. The previous Jason Bourne adventure he penned surprised me: I liked it. Then came this one. And I was again disappointed. Mr. Van Lustbader trades a decent vocabulary for the constant and completely unnecessary use of the famed  f  word. It isn't pleasant reading.  Add to that a book that seemed never-ending with all the various plot complications and a huge cast of characters and I found myself just racing through the book just to get to the end. I kept hoping it would get better. Now I regret having spent so much time on such a mediocre read when I could have been reading something engrossing, or thrilling or just plain good.  I guessing that next time I come across a Van Lustbader book - Jason Bourne or not - I will think twice before plucking it off the shelf. He's an over-rated writer. \",\n",
       "   \"There were parts of this book that I really got into: some of the action sequences, Bourne, his allies, the villains, the robust settings from Sweden to Mexico City to Lebanon, and then there was the other 2/3 of the novel. It seems like the author felt the need to have so many characters double-cross each other because Robert Ludlum would've approved. But there comes a point when too much is just too much. I have been a sucker for the Bourne series going back to the original trilogy, but the continuation of him in these books needs to sharpen up or I'm out. \",\n",
       "   \"Sadly...not impressed. Does anyone know of an author that can write a great spy novel/political thriller that knows how to write without using the F-word every few pages? Help me out here. I'm having a hard time finding them.\",\n",
       "   'Double and triple agents. Characters with three names. Improbable connections. Wheels within wheels. Overly complex and annoying. This Jason Bourne is not the Bourne of the Ludlow novels. He has the skills but not the soul. Thumbs down. ',\n",
       "   \"Horribly convoluted, poorly written attempt at a spy novel. Utterly unreadable. I had never heard of Van Lustbader when I picked this up, I was mainly drawn by the Bourne product name which usually guarantees quality in my experience of the Ludlum works.  Lustbader has vainly attempted to appeal to the short attention spans of a younger audience though lacks any real story-telling panache, consistently offering one and two (sometimes three) page scenes that cause the story to stop-and-start, not ebb and flow. Several characters and several strands of the plot are introduced simultaneously and subsequently abandoned in subsequent chapters, which can be confusing. Add to this mix the fact that Van Lustbader can't write much better than Matthew Reilly and the book starts to snowball into a massive failure.  There is not one scene in the novel that will inspire or excite you. It feels drab and dull. The plain, dry writing style fails to grab you and combined with the convoluted plot I lost interest very quickly. The constantly changing perspectives don't give time for any exposition and scenes are rushed to the finish, causing characters to appear very one dimensional. I sure didn't see any of Robert Ludlum's Bourne in this novel. Just a cardboard-cutout hero who mentions elements of previous (better) Bourne novels to remind the reader who he is. His dialogue is sparse, uninvolving. His sidekicks are given no backstory or exposition.  Poor writing and plotting aside, Van Lustbader is simply not cut out as an action writer. His perception of espionage operating procedures is childish and cliched, especially his depiction of women as little more than typical femme-fatale assassins. Set pieces fizzle and aren't exciting in the slightest, failing to effectively get the adrenaline going and feeling as if they go on for hours. He also has an over-reliance on extraordinary coincidences and  magic , assuming that nobody can hide from a spy killer anywhere in the world and never offering any explanation for why the bad guys show up and how they managed to follow Bourne and his lackeys halfway around the world with no trail to go on.  I gave up at around page 100, see if you can do better. It's amateur hour at it's best. Pick your cliche. Re-read an old Ludlum novel instead.\",\n",
       "   \"My first Bourne novel which I read, but have seen the movies over and over again! Always wanted to read this series, hence the leap of faith and I was not disappointed. The book starts when a man is shot by a Mossad agent, Rebeka, and he falls in the river and is flown down stream only to be picked up byJason Bourne. For Jason, it's deja vu and hence he wants to help him. He saves the guy and takes him back to the place where he saved him. And that's when the plot starts to unfold into a bigger plot, where the drowning man was actually sent to kill Jason.  Plenty of sub plots have been ingrained in the novel by the author to build up the suspense of the book. Lots of characters were introduced in the first part of the book. And no geographical location was left out of this novel - Sweden, Mexico, China, Lebanon, Israel, US, UK! And Eric's writing style includes too much context switching between multiple subplots and characters, at times left me a bit frustrated. But then, all these subplots in the end are quite nicely linked to the main plot and final climax is quite a nice culmination of the book. All the loose ends tied up, Bourne takes care of the villains but loses someone he loves in the process - all in a days work for Jason and makes the readers happy. Well, yes, to some extent.  The best thing about this book was time spent on grooming each character that was brought to life in the first part and subsequently taken out in the last part. It was really meticulously combed and felt great reading them. Perhaps Eric's too much context switching from one subplot to the other was justified to keep the readers riveted to the book. What felt nice was the action mentioned in the book is in perfect dose, not too much but not too less as well, enough to hold the readers imagination.  Overall a good fast read. Would now read move in this series by Eric.\",\n",
       "   \"I like the Bourne movies, but I've never been able to get past the first few chapters of the third book. I think it's probably because those first few books are awfully dated (and the movies stray so far from them that they're hardly similar any more), and I was hoping that even though I hadn't read the books between this one and those first few that I might like it better. I think I did, though there are definitely things I was missing because I didn't know the recent history of the characters. I think I like Lustbader's style better than Ludlum's, though I'd be hard pressed to mention the differences. This is an action book, through and through. You'll find political drama, a lot of whodunit (there's another character with amnesia, after all), some romance, and not a little cheesy dialogue. The settings range all over the world, and there are some gritty, ugly places that Bourne and his fellow spies have to deal with. Quite a few people betray others, and there are deaths and injuries that might take you by surprise. Sometimes the plot moves slowly, but it builds to an intense finish. One of these days I'll go back and try to read some of the other books in the series so I can figure out what the characters were talking about. The characters sometimes spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about what they're going to do and what they've done, but if you can make it through those parts, you'll be rewarded with detailed action. I received this as a digital ARC via Netgalley and the publisher.\",\n",
       "   \"I was disappointed in the latest Jason Bourne thriller. For me there were actually too many characters that it was hard to maintain focus on the action. Its not a vote against Eric Van Lustbader who was charged by the Ludlum estate to continue the legacy following Robert Ludlum's death. Some of his earlier effots have been OK but not thia time. The mix includes the usual Threadstone line-up, the Isaraeli Mossad, a Mexican drug lord, a Chinese politian and a cast of thousands which is the problem. No matter I did finish it but it didn't do much for me.\",\n",
       "   \"What a terrible read. The story was too convoluted and too many characters and things going on. Could not finish fast enough as I slowly got through the book. Won't be reading any more books with Ludlum's name on it that wasn't written by Ludlum. It was so bad I thought it might be me. So I picked up the latest Vince Flynn book and its as captivating as his preceding books. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on The Bourne Imperative. \",\n",
       "   'now i am hooked. This was such a great, easy and creative book. i was hooked after the first page.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.\",\n",

       "  'review': [\"As a fan of both mystery and Amish fiction novels, I was delighted when I found that free copies of Shunning Sarah, by Julie Kramer, were up for a giveaway on this site. Luckily, I was one of the eight chosen to receive a free advance copy from Atria. Knowing that Julie Kramer is a National Best Seller, and based on reviews of her past novels, I was confident that I would enjoy the mystery aspect of the novel. What I was a little more hesitant about was the accuracy of the Amish aspect of the novel. Having read Lewis, Woodsmall, Fisher, Brunstetter (among others) and combined with the research I've done on Amish culture and language, I was hesitant when I first cracked open Shunning Sarah. The last thing I wanted to read was an otherwise fascinating novel that was full of inaccuracies concerning the main suspects.  Luckily, my fears were ungrounded. Not only did I get a crash course into the world of Riley Spartz and investigative reporting, but the Amish aspects that I read where intriguing and - most importantly - largely correct. In addition to a murder on Amish soil, the reader also gets to grapple with an angry bear on the loose, Riley's unconventional new boss, and corruption within the law.  When it comes to mystery novels, the ending often makes or breaks the book. For fear of divulging too much information, I won't say too much other than you won't be disappointed! Many aspects of this novel are largely unprecedented when it comes to Amish culture and the ending will leave you thinking long after you finish the last page and put the book back on the shelf. Is someone truly unforgivable? When should a society that values forgiveness over revenge finally seek help from outsiders to help protect loved ones? And these are only a couple of questions... Overall, if you are looking for a great mystery novel - one that will keep you turning the pages well past midnight - pick up a copy of Shunning Sarah! Even those who haven't read the previous installments in the Riley Spartz series (like me) can appreciate this book as a stand alone novel if need be. As for me, I will certainly be reading the four previous books in the series and anxiously awaiting more in the future! \",\n",
       "   \"A solid one and a half stars--and a mental note to avoid this series, forever. In the summer, I like  lite  reading: mysteries, nanny diaries, chick lit, and thrillers. And, especially, series where I can read a long string, watching characters develop. But they have to be well-written.  This book read like the author's daily journal, if the author was a heroic, whip-smart journalist ready to take on all challenges. When I say it read like a daily log, I mean that the story wandered all over the place (as real life does), making it occasionally incomprehensible. First the bear, then the Amish, then a corn maze, then the old boyfriend, then grisly murders--and oh yeah, what about that soldier bravely serving his country in the middle east? Did he kill somebody? Throwing in everything but the kitchen sink, all couched in prosaic writing. Bleah. The extra half star comes from a twist: Kramer makes the Amish the bad guys. That takes cajones. Not enough to save the book, however.\",\n",
       "   \"I am ashamed to say that I won this book nearly FOUR years ago and just got around to reading it. WHY, oh why, didn't I pick this up sooner? I LOVED it and I WILL be picking up more of Julie Kramer's books. SOON. Riley Spartz is an investigative reporter and when a  boy trapped in a hole  story becomes a murder investigation, she is on top of it. This murder mystery has it all: Suspense, sex, lies, fraud, money, and even a few dogs. If you're a fan of the genre, check this series out.  *** I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads *** THANK YOU GOODREADS FIRST READS AND ATRIA!\",\n",
       "   \"I've enjoyed listening to these books. I think they can be a bit verbose but I also enjoy learning about the ins and outs of the television news business. \",\n",
       "   'I never read mysteries, but since this was about the Amish in Filmore County, Minnesota, where I camped for many years, and even bought an Amish quilt, I was hooked. Not sure I will be a mystery reader on a regular basis, but found this book intriguing.',\n",
       "   \"Riley Spartz is an investigative reporter in Minneapolis who knows a good news story, even when her new boss Bryce doesn't. When she gets a tip about a ten year old boy who has fallen into a sink hole in Harmony Minnesota, a rural area that is in the middle of an Amish community, she convinces her boss that it is a newsworthy story. By the time she arrives on the scene though the little boy Josh Kueppers has already been rescued.Undaunted Riley decides to interview the sheriff on the scene, and soon learns that there is another story. A dead body was down in the sinkhole with Josh, a body that might be hard to identify because it is missing its face. Riley is determined to see the case solved, even if it puts her own life in jeopardy. I am a huge fan of Amish fiction and when there is mystery and suspense involved I know I am in for a great read. With  Shunning Sarah  the author spins a story that pulled me in from the beginning.  A little boy trapped, I wondered how or if he would be saved, but then the real story begins after he is rescued. A woman's body at the bottom of the sinkhole who turns out to be an 18 year old Amish girl named Sarah Yoder. What happened to Sarah? Well that question kept me turning the pages to find out. As a fan of Amish fiction I admit I was most fascinated by the Amish portion of the story, but there was also an interesting secondary story going on as well that involved the drama of TV news. Ms. Kramer is truly knows how to paint a picture with her words, she brings her scenes, and characters to life, without being overly graphic in her descriptions.  Even though this book wasn't the first in the Riley Spartz series I had no problems diving right in. The author provided enough background information so that I didn't feel lost. While Riley was the main character in the story, for me I couldn't get Sarah out of my head, as her story is finally revealed my heart broke for her. Fans of mystery, suspense,and a plot filled with more twists than a winding country road will certainly want to read this one, the Amish twist is an added bonus. On a scale of one to five I would easily give this book a six, and plan on going back and reading the rest of the series! Highly recommended. A complimentary copy of this book was provided in exchange for an honest review. \",\n",
       "   \"This is my first introduction to the Riley Spratz series by Julie Kramer and I am very impressed. She has a captivating writing style that keeps you reading. The main character Riley Spartz is a television news reporter whose investigative skills take her deep into a mystery in the Amish country of Minnesota. Amish books particularly in the romance field are very popular these days. I would imagine it is because in our complicated technology filled lives it is nice to go to a simpler place...the land of the Amish. They live amongst us but are not anything like us. They are a mystery to us. The Amish tend to fascinate me as well. I'll never forget a little Amish girl waving at me from the back of a buggy in Ohio as we rode by her family on our Harley early one summer morning. And maybe she won't forget the leather clad Harley riding woman smiling and waving back at her. Our murder victim Sarah was a young Amish woman who was being shunned. She was no longer living among the Amish when she was murdered. Shunning to most North Americans is a very mysterious concept but those of us who lived among the Mennonites who are very similar in belief but not as strict in lifestyle have no problem understanding shunning. Why Sarah was being shunned is not revealed until late in the story and is of course integral to the plot. Great story that had me guessing until the end. I learned a lot about south eastern Minnesota and I learned a lot about the television news business. All in all I was very impressed by the easy flowing writing style of the author. I will try to catch up on the earlier books and am looking forward to more from Julie Kramer. Shunning Sarah is out on August 7th so be sure to preorder a copy.\",\n",

       "   \"This one was really frustrating to me. I liked the amish part of the story and found it interesting. I didn't like the reporter parts as much. I found the fact that the author kept telling about what happened before this, apparently in her last book, slightly annoying. I don't normally like if you can't read a book as a stand alone, and at least make it make sense. I did like the ending, although I found it slightly unbelievable, but still satisfactory. I found the side stories about the sexual harrassment at the workplace, the bear, and the corrupt cop, boring and not necessary for the main story. I think it would have been better if the amish part of the story was told alone and was a shorter story. This is my first book by this author. I thought it was okay. \",\n",
       "   \"Eh. My mom told me to read it and raved about how awesome it was. But it was only ok. The premise of the story was good, but what really bugged me was the author is local (which is fine), but how many Minnesota references does she want to make? I swear every other page she was making a mention about small town MN life, or referencing some MN landmark or history etc. It was very annoying and distracting. I get it, you hail from MN and want to show your MN pride but come on! Also, this book had about 5 different endings. You think you are getting to the end of the book and you go,  But there is like 100 pages left.  Then it doesn't end. Then you think it is going to end...and it doesn't. END THE STUPID BOOK ALREADY! I don't need 12 different endings.\",\n",

Even though the storyline was a bit lackluster, it was fun to read about some of our local favorites being included in the book, such as The Village Square and Quarter/quarter. It took me a LONG time to get through the first half of the book, but things did improve as the story lines started coming together in the final chapters. Worth a read if only for the local references and the fact that the author will be speaking in Harmony on April 6! :-)',\n",

As for the killer, I suspected the brother from the beginning. Most of the book was painfully slow and the whole situation with Bryce really annoyed me.

Some parts seem to take too long to conclude, yet other parts are over much too quickly. There is only one more book in this series, and hopefully, Julie Kramer will be able to draw all the parts of Riley's life together and maybe see a happily ever after for her.  You have to go with what mom says and if she is pointing you towards the body of an Amish girl and you are a news reporter, you had better grab your camera and go. Oh, and do not get distracted by a bear. Apparently, there is one in the woods that has others grabbing their guns.  When a local boy falls into a sinkhole, no one expected that hole to be hiding the dead body of a woman wrapped in a quilt, but that is exactly what happened when Josh Kueppers falls in and comes face to face with her. Doing what any other panicked child with a shotgun would do, he blows off her face. Now with no way of identifying the woman, the local police and Channel 3 reporter Riley Spartz set out to find out who this woman could be. Come to find out that the dead woman is Sarah Yoder from the nearby town of Harmony. Since this is technical outside of the broadcast area that her market audience is from, Riley has to battle the new news director. He is a disgusting sort, but this story is too interesting and Riley is willing to put up with just about anything to keep her news followers up-to-date on her findings.  The Amish are a quiet self-contained community and they have no need of the devil in the form of television or its reporters, but that does not stop Riley. As she digs further into Sarah's life and shunning, Riley's life, if not her hair, is in danger. Being slow on the uptake, she eventually figures out most of the parts, but not before she is running for her life and needs to climb into a bear's den to get the help that she needs.  By the end, Sarah's tormented life is revealed, yet Riley is not comfortable sharing it all. She will make sure that those that need to be protected will be. She will see a grieving mother, yet not feel sorry for her. Riley will do what she can, but right now, she needs to go home, to the farm and her parents. Her own personal life is in turmoil, but that can wait for another day. Today she just needs her family. \",\n",
       "   \"My oldest grabbed this off the inspirational shelf and I ended up reading it. I liked that it wasn't the typical Amish fiction where girl is bemoaning her Amish life and can't decide if she wants to marry the Amish guy and eventually she stays and marries. I liked that but I will admit I'm mystified by the fact it's considered inspirational as there was much in the way of Christianity, unless you count Riley's few conversations with a Catholic priest, religious. She does get anointed at the end of the book by the priest even after he refuses her first request for last rites. That said this is also not published by a Christian publisher, there are a few words that I consider cuss words, and there are a few times where there is some passion between Riley and two male characters.  I really did enjoy the book though even with the issues I pointed out above I'm just not sure this should have been shelved in with the rest of the inspirational/Christian fiction books. This one can stand alone and I'll probably check out more of the Riley Spartz series because overall I enjoyed the different writing style and also Riley's widowhood has piqued my interest and since I jumped in with the fifth book I want to hear more of the story.\",\n",
       "   \"Started somewhat strong - good storyline, but main character is flat to me, as were her relationships. Maybe because this was a series, it would've helped to have read in order. Surprising, if that's true. Usually the author paints a better picture of what happened in previous books, especially when it's backstory, not anything relating to the current plot. Who was Garnett? Just her ex-fiancee. Nothing to make you feel she's sorry he's gone. (Maybe she's not!) Did she feel any sense of remorse about Ike? No idea, and he was part of the current plot! Any memories of her deceased husband? A few - that she had one, and near the end, how he passed in a very brief explanation. All in all, I didn't feel really invested in the main character or her issues. \",\n",

There was too much going on to make this thing stick. Predictable storyline. Kinda boring. I couldn't tell what age the narrator was portraying for the main character?? This lady's voice sounded maybe 50s-60s. But then would talk about engagement, marriage, children, her sex life, etc in a way that you think maybe she's 35-40? I mean, I just could never figure it out.  I felt as though her  Amish  accent sounded more Italian than anything. I have not read or listened to previous books in the series, and I don't feel as though this would have made any difference. The ending was boring.\",\n",
       "   \" Almost from the start, I felt like I was reading a novel written by a high school student. Very simple sentence structure and dialogue, and WAY too many stories tied into one. Still, I read the whole book.   Why two stars? I certainly can't write a novel myself, so I have to give Kramer credit. Plus, I quickly learned this is one in a series about television reporter Riley Spartz (what an annoying character—not sure how she experiences any success on the job or in her romantic life), so the author must have a following.   I would rank this slightly above a Harlequin romance (or a tv comparison would be a Hallmark or Lifetime movie). If you enjoy those, and I don't, this might be the series for you. \",\n",

This story is a religious mystery in SE Minnesota within the Amish Community. This religious sec does not integrate with the  English  people, as Amish people remain separate unto themselves.

Orphan children are going missing, and among those looking into the mysterious state of affairs are a quick-witted twenty-two-year-old trader, Blandine von Couvering, herself an orphan, and a dashing British spy named Edward Drummond.,Suspects abound, including the governor's wealthy nephew, a green-eyed aristocrat with decadent tastes; an Algonquin trapper who may be possessed by a demon that turns people into cannibals; and the colony's own corrupt and conflicted orphanmaster. Both the search for the killer and Edward and Blandine's newfound romance are endangered, however, when Blandine is accused of being a witch and Edward is sentenced to hang for espionage. Meanwhile, war looms as the English king plans to wrest control of the colony.,Jean Zimmerman brings New Amsterdam and its surrounding wilderness alive for modern-day readers with exacting period detail. Lively, fast paced, and full of colorful characters, ,The Orphanmaster, is a dramatic page-turner that will appeal to fans of Hilary Mantel and Geraldine Brooks.\",\n",

       "  'review': [\"3.5 stars   Though there's a mystery at the heart of this story, the book's strongest suit is its depiction of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in the 1660s. New Amsterdam's Director-General, Petrus Stuyvesant, rules under the auspices of the Dutch West India Company, whose main goal is to make money.  Thus, numerous residents of New Amsterdam are traders - dealing in grains, furs, weapons, blankets, household items, etc. Life in the territory can be harsh though - with deadly diseases, serious injuries, and sporadic Indian attacks.  The hard work in New Amsterdam is broken up by the occasional holiday festival, where residents drink, dance and flirt.  Excess revelry is risky though, because Director-General Stuyvesant inflicts harsh sentences for bad behavior. One penalty - being bounced around for hours while astride a thin wooden plank - is horribly painful and can leave a miscreant with a bloody broken tailbone. (Ouch!!)  On top of his other concerns Stuyvesant is anxious about the English colonies surrounding New Amsterdam.....and he has good reason to be. Britain is planning to take over the Dutch settlement and sends Edward Drummond - a spy pretending to be a grain merchant - to scope out Dutch defenses and help plot the coup. One of the cleverest traders in New Amsterdam is a 'she-merchant' named Blandine van Couvering, a beautiful, independent young woman. Unlike most residents of the colony, Blandine is close friends with black people (former slaves) and Indians.  A wealthy Dutch businessman named Kees Bayard is almost engaged to Blandine, but his 'conditions' for marrying her are off-putting. In any case, Kees gets jealous when Blandine forms a rapport with Drummond, and this plot line forms an important part of the story.  The main theme of the book involves the disappearance of orphans - one by one - from New Amsterdam. Aet Visser, the orphan master, is in charge of parentless children. He generally sends them to local homes, where the unfortunate kids are often treated like servants or workers (or worse). Several orphans have now completely vanished, and Blandine enlists Drummond's help to look into the matter.  It soon becomes clear that the children are being murdered in a ritualistic fashion and - since New Amsterdam contains its share of odd people - there are plenty of suspects. Moreover, rumors fly about the 'witika' - a mask-wearing Indian demon who's (purportedly) been seen skulking around the forest. The book has numerous interesting characters including: Martyn Hendrickson - one of the richest, most handsome men in town....but he stinks (literally); Lightning - a half-Indian, half German who was almost scalped; Anna - Aet Visser's maid and the (secret) mother of his children; Antony Angola, a giant black man who protects Blandine; Kitane - an Indian fur trader who knows a lot about the witika; and more.  Chasing and shooting scenes add excitement to the story, and I was intrigued by descriptions of everyday life in New Amsterdam, including food, clothing, wigs (for men), sewing circles (gossip sessions), religious practices, business dealings, family dynamics, and so on.  The story moves along at a steady clip for about two-thirds of the book. Then, Blandine and Drummond - accused of various crimes by resentful and frightened townsfolk - go into hiding. The story slows down at this point and I became anxious to get to the climax.....and the unmasking of the orphan killer. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to fans of historical fiction. You can follow my reviews at  http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/\",\n",
       "   \"First, the writing is awkward and clunky. It's third person omniscient, but she's inconsistent in her omniscience, like, sometimes we are with the crazy killer and we know just what he's thinking (and yes, it's exactly who you think it is), and sometimes it's a mystery. She doesn't seem to have a handle on how to deal with information, like, at all, so we either get confusing withholding, or a deathly dull information dump. Second, Writing historical fiction doesn't mean you have to give us an  on this day in 16whenever, this happened  lesson every fifth chapter. Dial it back. Third, the mystery itself is obvious and not at all scary. Fourth, she doesn't trust the reader. Either quote a bunch of non-English languages and let the quotes be, or just write in English and pretend all the Dutch and native people are speaking in their respective language. Writing a two-word phrase in Dutch (OR LATIN) and then immediately writing its English translation is distracting, plus it reads like the author doesn't think her audience is clever enough to do the translation, or if nothing else google it. It's insulting. Right, also most of the characters are two-dimensional and entirely unsympathetic. What a waste of an afternoon.\",\n",
       "   \"In my imaginary Fenimore Cooper School of Literary Offenses, there's a popular class on how to write irritating historical novels. Writers are encouraged to apply modern ideas to past cultures. Jean Zimmerman surely took this course. Her heroine Blandina, who lives in New Amsterdam just before it falls to the British, is an independent trader. So far so good. But then we find she's best buddies with the African Americans shunned by the rest of the colony, not to mention with a native American. Hmm. Dances With Wolves, anyone? Zimmerman did her research, and got many details right, but she slips at Christmas, describing the wassails (British), the yule log (German) and the children's presents. Christmas is a Victorian construct - if they celebrated anything in New Amsterdam, it would have been New Year's. But my favorite literary offense in this book was when Blandina and her English boyfriend escape by sleigh up the Hudson, where they find a magic cabin sparkling with frost. Somehow they manage to live here for three weeks on sunshine and sex - where does their food come from? And how much fun can the sex be if you have no other clothes and only cold water to wash with? They manage somehow, and return to triumph over the bad guys. \",\n",
       "   'This book had a lot of amazing qualities: historical facts, interesting premise, some well developed and unique characters, but it lacked proper pacing to keep you hooked. Thrillers need to read like a runaway train, and this read more like a commuters local. ',\n",
       "   \"Every now and then I read a book that just takes my breath away. It feels like the author wrote the book just for me, and I just can't put it down. This one, which I won through the goodreads' first reads (yeah!) giveaways was just that. It was just so brilliant that I'm really struggling how to put it into words. It is set in a period of history about which very little is written in historical fiction - early New York history, when it was still a tenuous colony of intrepid Dutch men and women, given rein to do what they needed to in order to succeed. The imperative of a successful colony meant that women had far more rights than in their homeland at the time, or for some centuries afterwards, and also that one hard man, Peter Stuyvesant is judge, jury and executioner overseeing the daily lives of the colonists and maintaining law and order. It is also time of turmoil across the Atlantic. Europe is struggling to achieve normality, prompted by the return of Charles II, a highly intelligent, charismatic, courageous and flawed man, to the throne in England, after the bloody and savage Civil War, and silently, the men that put his father to death are being hunted down and murdered. Catherine the Great is dragging Russia into Europe, and in France the Sun King, Louis XIV, has ascended the throne he'll occupy for a record 72 years. The Netherlands itself was celebrating after winning independence from Spain after an 80 year struggle, and was firmly in its Golden Age. That's the incredible backdrop to this story. So, how do we go from that, through amazingly detailed, and never tedious, descriptions of daily life in the New Amsterdam colony, to the story of a particularly gruesome set of murders of children? Oh, and all the while, write a really compelling romance? I'm not sure how the author does it, but she does! There are so many characters, all flawed, all harboring secrets, and yet, none of them are simple black and white, evil or good, but a mixed up, confusing grey sludge. Even the main hero (there are several heroes) is a study in what happens when you lose your moral compass, and one of the secondary heroes, well, even now, I don't know what to really think of him - his nature and beliefs are so far removed from my own, that I can't even bring myself to judge him. So, 5 stars, absolutely brilliant, all-time-favorite (and even has a beautiful cover), and I really, really hope this author writes more historical fiction like this.\",\n",
       "   \"Jean Zimmerman writes in the afterward to her historical novel, The Orphanmaster, that her husband asked her to, “Write me a murder.” She should have ignored him and concentrated on writing an historical adventure novel that interweaves the lives of its characters with the historical and political events of the time, instead of an ill-conceived and poorly executed period murder mystery. The best parts of the novel involve Blandine Van Couvering's rise as a female trader in the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1663, and Edward Drummond's role as an English spy gathering intelligence for the British crown. Zimmerman has done her historical research and it shows to good advantage in her descriptions of the daily lives and interactions of her characters. As in many first novels there are a few flaws in pacing and awkward shifts in time and perspective, but those can be ignored by a generous reader. What can't be ignored, however, is the inclusion of a thoroughly uninteresting serial killer, whose identity is easily guessed within the first 50 pages of the book. Serial killer novels are loathsome and tedious for three basic reasons: 1) very few authors thoroughly understand the psychology of serial killers, 2) even fewer authors can make a serial killer interesting, and 3) introducing a serial killer forces the writer to engage in violence porn (unnecessarily gruesome depictions of violence against the most helpless victims the author can imagine—in this case, orphan children). In fact, with each successive serial killer novel that gets written, the violence porn has to be notched up to higher and higher levels to engage a jaded public's disgust. It's time to retire the idiotic subgenre of serial killer novels altogether. Zimmerman struggles to make Blandine's and Eward's stories mesh with the serial killer's plotline. And so the last 100 pages of the book turn into one long string of improbable coincidences that includes an eye-rollingly bad chase scene that reads like it was lifted from the script of a bad Hollywood action film that went straight to DVD. Next time Zimmerman needs to ask herself what her strong female character, Blandine, would do. Blandine would tell her: “Don't listen to your husband. Do what you're good at and give us a great, well-researched, historical adventure novel that grounds your characters' stories in the historical changes of the time.” I so wanted to see Blandine build her trading empire and use her influence or her cunning to rescue Edward from the hangman's noose. Now THAT would have been a good book.\",\n",
       "   'This is a 4.5 for me, and the only thing that kept me from giving it a five is the crutch of formula mystery/crime writing that it leans on. The setting is outstanding, though. 17th century New Amsterdam is not a time/place I have read about before and Zimmerman captured the sounds, smells and sights of it as well as the inhabitants. A mixture of Dutch, English, German, Indian and African form the list of characters, and most are fully fleshed by the writing. There are significant scary moments(the Witika) and romantic moments(a secluded cabin in the wilderness), as well as truly suspenseful moments. The last 40 pages of the book alternates between two catastrophic episodes involving the two main characters, and left me on the edge of my seat. There were problems too,and those kept me from assigning the book 5 stars. There was a bit of predictability to the story, and the killer is revealed by clues too easy to ignore with a quarter of the book left. There was a formula being used for the plot, and despite the powerful setting, the bare bones of it were evident in certain places - particularly the climactic ending of search and rescue. It was a hard read to put down, and one I easily picked up, so it merits the title of good read from me overall.',\n",
       "   '“The Orphan Master” by Jean Zimmerman, published by Viking. Category - Fiction/Historical Fiction In 1663 Lower Manhattan was called New Amsterdam and was a Dutch Colony. The Dutch had a civil position known as “The Orphan Master” whose job was to watch over children who had lost both their parents. Aet Visser was “The Orphan Master” for New Amsterdam. He placed children in homes or places where they could work. Edward Drummond, an Englishman, comes to New Amsterdam to scout the area for a possible English invasion. He becomes involved with a young lady, Blandine van Couvering. Blandine was an orphan and is now a very successful trader. The town is terrified by the witika. The witika is a demon that seems to be abducting young children, but only those than have been orphaned, and is a flesh eating monster. Edward finds himself being accused as a spy and Blandine accused of being a witch. They both find themselves fighting for their lives and also trying to uncover they mystery of the witika and the missing children. The book is very, very slow and tiresome. Although it does show signs of promise towards the end, most readers will have already closed the book. ',\n",
       "   \"The best thing about The Orphanmaster is its historical detail. Zimmerman does an excellent job of setting the scene and integrating issues and concerns the colonists had during that time. The legend of the witika was delightfully horrific, and I enjoyed reading about it. This story has lots of drama to keep the reader entertained. Though the first half is a bit slow, the second half really picks up and it is simply a race to the end. I will say that this is not for everyone, as it is rather graphic. Some of the violence and gruesome details were unnecessary, I think, and only used for shock value, which I dislike, but most of it fits in with the mystery of the orphan disappearances in the colony. In terms of characters, Blandine was my absolute favorite. She is so strong and really stands on her own. Though there are men in her life who help her, she doesn't lean on them and she's perfectly capable of taking care of herself. I really appreciated that and was rooting for her to overcome the patriarchal and suspicious society she lives in. For all of its detail, I do think that the history overshadows the story. I think some of the setting could have been cut to make room for more plot and character development that would have added a richness to both. As it was, I didn't feel connected to any of them except for Blandine. Even then, I only really connected with her because she's a strong female character dealing with the ideals and prejudices of people living in the seventeenth century. And for a mystery, there wasn't much suspense. It's just sort of life-as-usual with the kidnappings in the background, when they should have been the focus of the story. Also, once enough information is given about the people in the town, it is obvious who the killer is. The characters take a lot longer to figure it out, which was frustrating for me. I enjoyed the story overall, however. Fans of historical fiction will enjoy how effortlessly Zimmerman transports the reader to another time and place, and fans of mystery will enjoy the legend of the witika and the completely psychotic murderer. *I was given a free copy of this book by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.*\",\n",
       "   \"This is one of the best historical/mystery/suspense books I've ever read. Author Jean Zimmerman has written an incredibly compelling novel about life, love and murder in New Amsterdam (lower Manhattan) in 1660. Ms. Zimmerman's attention to detail and knowledge of life and the history of the early days of Manhattan bring realism and depth to this tale of grizzly murder, . The main character is a strong and spirited heroine, Blandine van Couvering - Blandine, an orphan herself, is artfully drawn into the mystery when the town's orphans begin disappearing. Blandine meets an English gentleman Edward Drummond, who has come to New Amsterdam at the behest of the King of England, on a secret mission. The two embark upon an urgent search for the answer to the question,  What has happenened to the children?  Beautiful language, passionate romance, gruesome crimes, against a backdrop of the politics, religion, the hard life of the colonists keep the reader riveted. I loved this book.\",\n",
       "   \"An historical novel, yes, but oh so much more! Author Jean Zimmerman has meticulously researched the data on the colony established by the Dutch West India Company in the 1600s. The colony, New Amsterdam, will eventually become Manhattan, but in 1660 it is a bustling center of commerce under the iron fist (and wooden leg) of Petrus Stuyvesant. One of the bureaucratic jobs in the community is the Orphan Master. His job is to oversee and protect and provide for the orphans there. Orphans may have originally been part of families where parents died from disease or other traumatic events, or they may have been orphans in the fatherland who were occasionally rounded up and sent across the sea to serve as indentured servants performing all the drudge work that the bustling, growing economy requires. The Dutch culture in that era allows much more freedom for women than the English, which means that Blandine van Couvering, orphaned at 15, is allowed to continue in the work of her family and thus is one of the emerging  she-merchants  in the community. Currently she is 22, no longer a responsibility of the Orphan Master Aet Visser, but she still relies on him for advice and guidance. Visser himself seeks the aid of a new arrival in New Amsterdam, Edward Drummond. Though claiming to be a grain merchant, he is in actuality a spy for King Charles II of England, who intends to claim the territory now occupied by the Dutch. Visser asks Drummond to check on one of the orphans he has placed with the Godbolt family to confirm whether or not Visser's suspicions regarding this family are valid. Intrigue and suspense abound, as virtually everyone's end game is making money. This family stands to gain substantially when the orphan receives an inheritance from family across the sea. Visser doubts that the current child is the same one he placed there. The purpose of the New Amsterdam outpost is to collect and return beaver pelts to the fatherland, and the result is that traders and merchants abound, adeptly bartering tools and supplies, even guns, to the native American hunters and trappers who supply the pelts. Everybody wins!  But the ugly circumstance that the community slowly comes to notice is that orphans are occasionally disappearing. The citizens gradually comprehend that something, or someone, is targeting the most vulnerable among them. Deep fear and horror strike their hearts when bones of children are discovered in remote fire circles surrounded by signs and totems that indicate a demon that is part of local indian lore, the witika, may be responsible. The witika demon is also associated with cannibalism. As unthinkable as it seems, there is no doubt a serial killer capable of great evil in their midst.  It isn't long before frightened people begin to suspect others in the community, and believe me, there is no shortage of possibilities! Because Blandine seems to be the only one concerned when one of the black community's children disappears, she is considered suspect, and possibly a witch. Since Visser is the only adult in the community charged with the responsibility of all the orphans, perhaps he bears guilt in the disappearances. This saga has so many twists and turns, so many interesting characters, and so many heart stopping moments of terror built into the story, that the reader's interest is held captive til the very end. There are so many reasons to recommend this book...here are two: One, it is NOT a trilogy, so I can assure you there is closure; and two, though it has just come out in print, it is about to become a movie so you need to read it first and cast it in your own mind to see if you are thinking like the great minds of Hollywood...just sayin... \",\n",
       "   \" The novel is set in 1663 when the Dutch ruled Manhattan. It's a time period I know virtually nothing about so I was excited about the book. The Dutch had some very forward thinking ideas about women. A woman, after marriage, was allowed to work and retain property in her own name. The protagonist in the story is Blandine van Couvis, a merchant trader.  Blandine has some odd associates including a giant black man who survived a hanging and an Indian who sometimes practices a little cannibalism when a fever attacks him. Blandine was an orphan and supervised by the town's Orphan Master. He made a nice profit from renting the orphans out to work for various people. Into this mix, enters Edward Drummond, a spy sent by King Charles II of England. His job is to study the Dutch defense so England can invade.  Orphans in town start to go missing and no one seems too bothered. Then they find their half eaten bodies and a panic ensues. Who's taking the orphans?  The life of the Dutch settlers was quite interesting. The houses had actual glass in the windows which surprised me. Even a hundred years later, glass was a luxury. The Dutch seemed to have some wonderful evolved ideas but were led by Stuyvesant who appears in the book to be quite incompetent. It makes you wonder who life would be if the Dutch had kept control of the area.  The story was good but very graphic and there were parts I skipped over for my own sanity. The writing was not quite smooth and this was a debut fiction novel. It could have used some judicious book editing but then so did Amy Tan and Elizabeth George in their latest efforts. The story kept my attention and overall I enjoyed it, just not too much. The writing and the graphic portrayals were negative aspects to me.\",\n",
       "   \"The Orphanmaster took a while for me to get into—too long, I thought—but when I finally did I was hooked. It's a murder thriller and a historical novel of the 1660s, set in fertile locale: the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, where a native creature called a witika is thought to be stealing and devouring orphans. There's a determined she-trader hero, a dissolute but seemingly good-hearted bureaucrat in charge of orphans, an English spy charged with tracking down the regicides who sentenced Charles I, and many more. There were actually too many characters, some overdrawn but introduced to add historical detail and texture. (The hilarious treatment of Peter Stuyvesant, however, was worth the price of admission.) There were some good plot twists and engaging history but also a bit of the kitchen sink thrown in. Definitely worth reading but I'm torn about recommending it to my book club…. \",\n",
       "   \"A story about a fictional string of orphan-murders in Manhattan's 17th Century Dutch New Amsterdam colony is certainly a great idea for a book, but what type? Is it a murder mystery? a historical romance? or is it literary fiction? Often, it feels like the writer herself hasn't quite decided. However, the final section of the novel delivers the answer with dead-on precision--it is a gruesome, nail-biting, shocker of a crime thriller. If only the preceding 375 pages matched the final 40. Still, this is a first novel and I have high hopes for future work from this writer.\",\n",
       "   \"I received this book from the publisher as part of Goodreads giveaway program, Firstreads. It was difficult to come up with a rating for this first novel by historian Jean Zimmerman. There are aspects of it that are really great, and yet it also has serious problems. The novel presents itself throughout as a mixture of genres - historical, mystery, horror, romance - yet is packaged as a literary work. This hodgepodge creates problems, yet somehow the work as a whole came out better for me than any of its individual component attributes on their own. At the end of the read, despite its many deep flaws, I have to admit it was entertaining, though by no means literary. The book clearly is strongest in its historical nature, due to Zimmerman's expertise in the setting. She has thus crafted a history lesson in the guise of a tale. Sometimes the history is incorporated into the text well, in the form of rich details or dialogue. But at other moments the history is given in thick packets of text as if the narrator has suddenly turned history professor, recounting the great events on Earth in the year of our Lord 1663... And the narrator... the story is told in third person omniscient, but shifts views within single pages between various characters, speaking as if the voice were from the era of the setting, but then explaining things in modern terms as if the reader were incapable of realizing what simple Latin phrases were. The voice is one moment deathly serious, describing some horrific grisly detail, but then switches to describe something else tongue-in-cheek, even breaking the fourth wall to gently poke the reader. The voice employed by Zimmerman is therefore just too inconsistent. Beyond the fascinating historical details of the novel lie some moments of true horror, featuring the Native American wittika (wendigo) mythology. Zimmerman is really adept at writing the horrific. I found the passages of these moments to be chilling and creepy without being exploitational or gratuitous. Unfortunately, she fails at the mystery genre. The story is certainly a thriller or suspenseful, but there is little mystery. The party responsible for the murder is obvious a few chapters in. This fault largely arises from the fact that the characters are all very flat and fail to change appreciably. It is almost like they come from a role playing game: Chaotic good, chaotic evil, neutral good, lawful neutral, etc. Guess which falls into the serial killer category. With character's 'alignment' so obvious and unswerving, the mystery fizzles.  Yet, despite these issues, I still enjoyed it a fair amount. The ride was interesting when I got past the ever-shifting voice, the historical aspects made new information still accessible, and the well-written suspense and horror of it made me look past the awkward romantic aspects that simply occur with little development or believability. Finally, the female protagonist, and believably rendered despite the 1663-context was uniquely interesting.  I'm not surprised at all to see this novel has been optioned for a movie. It is a Hollywood type plot through-and-through, with its mixture of genre that can have something to please everyone in the crowd. Zimmerman even writes as if it were a screenplay with action of the screen. Surrounding her dialogue, she alternates between detailed complex sentences and short phrases lacking complete grammar to convey atmosphere, as if they are stage directions.  If Zimmerman writes another novel I might give it a read depending what the genre is. I think she could easily fix the issues of this novel with more editing - and perhaps focusing on two genres rather than multiple.\",\n",
       "   \"Review originally posted  here . The Orphanmaster is Jean Zimmerman's debut novel. It is not, however, her first foray into publication by any stretch of the imagination. Zimmerman is, first and foremost, a historian. Earlier this year, I read her recently published Love, Fiercely, and quite enjoyed it. Despite that, The Orphanmaster wasn't really on my radar, and I was going to let it pass me by. Then, one of the lovely folks at Penguin offered me a copy for review, and I couldn't say no. Guys, I am so, so glad that she offered me an ARC of this and that I accepted. The first thing I have to mention is Zimmerman's writing. She has a way with words. The novel is complex and beautiful. I learned new terms and got to appreciate just how crazy Dutch looks. Reading The Orphanmaster is simply a pleasure, through all 416 long pages. This book took me some time to get through, but it was never a struggle. Now, the story. The story is completely epic. From the first sentence, which definitely had me hooked, I was completely entranced by this whole other world, the past, which Zimmerman transported me to. Set in New Amsterdam in the 1660s, a gigantic cast of characters is centered around the mystery of a series of murders of orphans, done either by a psychopath or a demon. The plotting and characterization reminded me somewhat of Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth, another book I love, although I think this one is better. In the first couple of chapters, I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters I was introduced to, all with very weird names, like Aet and Blandine. I worried I wasn't going to be able to track who was doing what, but Zimmerman does an excellent job, and after the initial onslaught, I had no issues with that. Blandine was by far my favorite character, which should come as no surprise. She's an independent, headstrong lass. An orphan herself, she is 22 and as-yet unmarried, though she certainly could be if she wanted to be. Instead, she works (very successfully, I might add) as a trader. I loved her strength, and her openness to other cultures. There are strong themes of racism through the book, and Blandine is a wonderful person who judges people by their actions, not their skin color. Just to warn you, this book can be quite gruesome. There are rapes, skinnings, murders and cannibalism. This is not a book for the faint of heart. None of this is done to excess or just for shock value, I don't think, but it is there. Prior to reading this book, I knew almost nothing about the Dutch presence in what is now New York. I knew they were there for a while, and that the Brits pushed them out. That was about the extent of my knowledge though. I think that period was generally glossed over in history classes as not especially important, or maybe I just forgot. Either way, getting to learn about that colony was totally awesome. There are so many completely fascinating historical goodies in here. If you like to learn from your books, you will love this. From start to finish, The Orphanmaster is dazzling. Historians should write historical fiction more often. I eagerly anticipate more novels from Zimmerman in the future!\",\n",
       "   \"A creature stalks the shadows of New Amsterdam. Known as the witika, it is a deranged beast that consumes the flesh of its fellow man. In Jean Zimmerman's The Orphanmaster, the witika has been blamed for a recent string of orphan kidnappings and killings. Dutch merchant Blandine von Couvering, who is an orphan herself, has her doubts, and sets out to solve the mystery with the help of British spy Edward Drummond, her servant/companion Antony, and Kitane, a Lenape trapper. Though it had its faults, The Orphanmaster was well-written and provided an engaging lens through which to learn about some interesting history. The central mystery was gripping, though most readers will probably figure out who/what the witika is fairly early on. (Though it took me until the final author's note to realize that the witika is the same legendary creature as the wendigo!) In part, this is because Zimmerman employs several point-of-view characters, including some who are thought to be the culprits behind the orphan kidnappings. Being able to solve the mystery didn't necessarily lessen the novel's tension, especially due to a revival of the creepiness during the third-act. Seasoned readers of mysteries may not be entirely impressed by the weak red herrings, but I thought Zimmerman's writing and setting were enough to give this thriller a fresh gloss. The B plot, about Drummond hunting down the judges who signed the death warrant for the formerly-exiled English King Charles the I, is interesting, but because Drummond isn't actually an assassin himself, I was much more intrigued by the witika, and it's really the mystery that drives the plot. One of this novel's greatest strengths is the commitment to historical detail. Zimmerman lovingly illustrates New Amsterdam for us, from its dirty cobbled alleyways to the food served at its pubs. The setting pulses with energy, with sights and smells, with the clink of wampum, with the rolling tides. It was not surprising to me at all to discover that Zimmerman is a historian who has previously published nonfiction. Her world-building was really exceptional. It's also fascinating to be able to compare the New York City of today with its beginnings during this period of time. Similarly, I thought she did excellent work conveying the wildness of the New World, and how perilous the settlement's position was, threatened by American Indians, the English, and the raw power of nature itself, simultaneously threatening and bewitching.

       "   \" This is set on Manhattan Island, part of New Amsterdam, a trading Dutch settlement very early in the history of our country as a new country. Things are just beginning to simmer as far as who owns, who has rights in trading, all those qualities that are disputable to those looking for business possibilities and how to best exploit them. And the new world is ripe with possibilities. Peter Steyvestant is the head of the colony and is known for his unwavering strictness and strong ideas. The orphan master is a position that was held...bringing the orphan children to areas where they can work and receive training (in the ideal, that is). Some are better than others. Visser does care about his kids, but it's a rough world and possibilities fir a nice life don't just float up. Questionable things are happening and as time goes on, people get more suspicious and more scared.   One thing I liked about the book was a lack of role models and heroes, and I find I like this. People are people not models of dedicated perfection. Many do their best in their own ways which are not necessarily polished or charming. There is something more real about this approach. And it's easier to relate to some of the very difficult situations that do exist as well. I thought the book was very worthwhile, but I can see where a lot wouldn't feel this way as well. Old legends have infused into some of the happenings and fear of the supernatural and witchcraft begin to influence some thinkings. And it was interesting when Peter Steyvesant started to reminisce and wonder why he and his family of influence were passed over by some of those whom he would have chosen to unite with....and he just doesn't understand. Although the reader easily can! A good book, I thought. But not a pretty one!\",\n",
       "   'It is 1663 in New Amsterdam.  If you an orphan, then most likely you have met the orphanmaster. He is the one that all the children know.  Blandine van Couvering grew up an orphan herself. She has done pretty well for herself these days. Having been an orphan, Blandine has a soft spot for the other orphan children. This is why when some of the orphan children go missing, Blandine takes it upon herself to lead a group and go hunting for the missing children. Blandine is joined by Edward Drummond, a British spy. Suspicions first lead to the orphanmaster but as Blandine and Edward draw closer tothe truth, they learn there is something more evil at work.  This was quite an interesting book. Although, the first half of the book does move slowly. However, if you stick with it, it does get better. I liked the historical aspect surrounding this story, especially regarding the Native Americans and the witika. The idea that a beast could have that much power to make people turn into cannibals is creepy. Unlike some of my fellow readers, I did not have a problem with the grusome eating of human flesh. I can see though, where some could be grossed out as it was emphasized but this was to help tell the story. The whole idea of the orphanmaster had me thinking of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The orphanmaster was in charge of all the lost children and he would lead them away.  Blandine is a strong female protagonist. She really helped lead the story. Being an orphan herself helped as she fought hard for all the missing children. While, I liked Edward too, I was not feeling so much the love interest between him and Blandine. I felt it took a bit of a side seat to the main focus of the missing children. A nicely done first novel by new author, Jean Zimmerman. The Orphanmaster comes calling!',\n",
       "   \"I was so excited to win an advance copy of this book through Goodreads. The cover looked amazing (I know, I know) and the story sounded so interesting, even if it wasn't my usual cup of tea. So the story takes place in what was once New Amsterdam and which is now Manhattan. The Dutch have control of the area and live more freely than their English conterparts. Women are allowed to trade and own property, former slaves are free to live as they please, and Native Indians mix (fairly) freely with the Dutch, mostly due to the trade industry. I don't usually read historical fiction, but what caught my eye on this book was the synopsis. The story follows the mystery of orphans who keep disappearing. On the case is the young she-merchant, Blandine, and the so-called 'dashing' English spy, Drummond, who is in America to hunt down the men who signed the former king's death warrant and fled to America to hide. Sounds pretty interesting, right? Well, it's not.  There were many things wrong with this book, here are a few: 1. the writing was clunky and tedious. It took me three weeks to get through this mess, but having won a free copy, I felt obligated to push through. 2. You know who is commiting the murders almost immediately! There is no mystery. The reader suspects who it is almost from the beginning (and you will be right) and then, like halfway through, it's revealed--and then still goes on for another 200 + pages. 3. So many unnecessary characters are introduced that just drag this already too-long book down.  What redeemed the book, slightly, was that the history is pretty interesting and I liked the two main characters enough to sludge through. If you like historical fiction, you might enjoy this book, but I'd have a hard time recommending it. \",\n",
       "   'In 1663, what we know today as lower Manhattan, was a querulous little Dutch colony known as New Amsterdam. Although established by the Dutch, it became an international trading center facing a time of transition. Originally, home to various indigenous peoples, Europeans and nationalities of all ethnic origins began to move through this gateway to North America, bringing about change as well as conflict. In this challenging world of the frontier, death is not only common but a constant and predictable companion and the death of adults often leave children as orphans, so many in fact, that the settlers have created a position of responsibility for a caretaker known as an orphan master. His obligation is to see that the orphans are placed among settled families, securing them as contributing members of the settlement. This system works well until the children begin to inexplicably disappear from the census roles and although the villagers ignore it in the beginning, strange stories of primitive sacrificial ceremonies circulate and ultimately, body parts begin to appear. In this immaculately researched historical world, every page exudes period detail and atmosphere. A spirited narrative takes the reader on a journey that intriguingly incorporates the elements of a spy novel, a mystery, a horror story and a love story---the engine of the story---equally mixed with an element of humor. This is a well written and entertaining novel about a period of American history that is often overlooked.',\n",
       "   \"A proper murder mystery requires two very important elements: Sleuthing by its main protagonist/s (whether it be professional or amateur), and a tight, carefully structured  who done it  that serves up clues, red herrings, and plot twists to keep us guessing as to the murderer's identity and motives. 'The Orphanmaster' is sorely lacking in both of these departments. Blandine and Edward Drummond, the Dutch she-merchant and English spy who serve as heroine and hero as well as amateur sleuths, briefly discuss investigating the grisly, ritualistic murders (because that seems to be the convention in mystery now-a-days--no more quiet stabbings in libraries, now everyone is being ripped to literal shreds by serial killers) taking place in New Amsterdam (or New York, before the British took over)... and then proceed to do not much aside from taking sleigh rides up frozen rivers. We are told (not shown) that they investigated, usually in one or two throw-away sentences, as if the author has remembered that they were supposed to be investigating. As for the murderer? I knew his identity the moment a particular character was introduced. This is a flaw. I do not read that many murder mystery novels. If an amateur such as myself can pin-point your killer within seconds, surely there is something amiss with your mystery. \",\n",

Dutch New Amsterdam, the southern tip of what would become Manhattan, in the 1660's, traders, trappers, River Indians and Mohawks are all represented. Charles II has been recalled to the throne and is set on having all those who signed his father's execution writ, murdered. Drummond is the King's man and sent to the new world to find those few men who have managed to escape England. Blandine, the main protagonist, is a young woman moving up in the world of trade and Aet Visor is the orphanmaster, the man in charge of bringing orphans to this place and making sure they are given to good homes for both care and labor. They all must come together to find who is killing orphans. This is a character and setting driven mystery as is extremely well done. Though a bit confusing at the beginning because the information imparted to the reader is extensive, the pure delight in reading the history of this area as well as the repeating characters, soon provides its own reward. The amount of historical research required for this book is impressive. This is truly a first rate historical read, with interesting concepts and characters. ARC from NetGalley. 1\",\n",

       "   '• The author who has written a non-fiction book on this time period, so she knows her stuff, but her writing did not appeal to me and at times the language was too much of the time so that made the story drag • I really enjoyed the character of Blandine van Couvering and she is one of the reasons I kept reading - she was a strong independent woman that remained true to her ambitions while earning respect. • There was really a position called “orphanmaster” who was “in charge” of the orphans (and any assets they might have) - those whose parents died in the New World, those whose parents died or were abandoned in Holland - they would be “given/hired out” or could just be left to roam the streets and fend for themselves • The portrayal of Peter Stuyvesant was not a flattering one - he came across as a buffoon and tyrant. • Learned about the witika - a flesheating demon that was part of the Algonquin Indian folklore (there version of vampires)',\n",
       "   \"Would recommend: Ehh This is a super strange book. I think it tried to be like  Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague  or maybe  The Crucible , but it came out so bizarre. It's like, early American settlement meets weird Dutch names meets independent heroine meets totally weird demonic possession and cannibalism. What? Like I said, SO WEIRD. Granted, I wanted to know how it ended, but when I read the last line, I think there was a giant cartoon question mark over my head, not because I didn't understand what happened, but because it was SO WEIRD. That is my takeaway here: SO WEIRD.\",\n",
       "   \"Though a lot of the subject matter was disturbing (there were definitely times I skimmed paragraphs detailing it), I thought this book was very interesting, and unlike anything I'd ever read before. It was a mystery set back in the 1600s, so you have the historical context behind the main plot of a serial killer taking orphaned children in the American colonies. I loved how the author switched the points of view of the narrator, so that you don't actually know who the killer is (or why you're learning about this event from a particular character). I do wish that the ending had been a bit different (I didn't love how it played out and still had a ton of questions about what happened after the main events), but otherwise, I really enjoyed it.\",\n",
       "   \"It's 1663 and Manhattan's orphans have begun to disappear. Their small bodies, if found, are mutilated in ways reminiscent of the  witika , the demon-beast of Indian lore. Initially, this book grabbed my interest but by the time I was half way through I was forcing myself to finish it. Once the murder is revealed (about 2/3 of the way in), the book strays through subplots before petering out to its final conclusion. The storyline meanders and at times was difficult to follow. That said, I did enjoy the historical nature of the book,, which was very well researched, about early Manhattan and the Dutch settlers. \",\n",
       "   \"2.5  The Orphanmaster attracted me because it promised a feisty female heroine, the setting of New Amsterdam (back when New York wasn't even New York yet) and an intriguing mystery surrounding the disappearance of orphans from the colony. While I got the first two, unfortunately I didn't get the third. Blandine van Couvering is a beautiful young woman who, unwilling to settle down into the life of a good obedient house wife, ventures into the trade business and finds her true calling. As this is an occupation that is frowned upon for a woman (even though the Dutch are more accepting than most) Blandine struggles to be accepted in the business. Blandine is also an orphan who grew up under the care of Aet Visser, the town Orphanmaster. While Visser has his own demons (drinking and corruption among them) he is the only father figure she has known. When Aet becomes suspicious over one of his orphan's he enlists the help of Edward Drummond, an Englishman newly arrived to the colony. What begins as a half hearted inquiry into the fate of a few missing orphans soon evolves into a partnership between Blandine and Edward to find out what is really going on in regards to the missing children and that discovery is gruesome and full of danger. First, I loved both the characters of Blandine van Couvering and the soldier turned spy Edward Drummond. Unconventional heroines are often my favorite characters in books and this was the case here. Blandine is tough enough to take on the boys in business but also has a soft spot for kids, as it seems she is just about the only one who cares that the orphan kids are disappearing. Edward is in the employ of Charles II and while in the Dutch Colony under the guise of grain merchant, his real purpose is to hunt down the regicides who sent Charles I to the scaffold (this is NOT a spoiler-it is revealed in the beginning of the book). Second, you can tell the novel is well researched from the level of detail it contains about life in New Amsterdam. The social hierarchy, the layout of the town, the principle occupations, are all included and were quite interesting to read. Unfortunately, I had several problems that kept me from enjoying this book. The story jumps around from character to character with absolutely no transition whatsoever. First we are following Blandine on some excursion and next it will be talking about Aet Visser or Kitane (Blandine's Indian friend) or Lightning (the half-Indian man everyone in town is scared of) and it seems at times there is nothing connecting these different occurrences. Also, for the first half of the novel the pacing is really slow. I kept wondering where the novel was going and when the story would pick up with a little more action. I think at half way through the novel the reader should have at least some indication. This combined with the flipping between characters made for awkward and slow reading. There were a few side stories going on that slowed down the reading even further. One involved the aforementioned concern of Aet Visser for one of his orphans that brought Edward Drummond into the mix in the first place. It seems the Orphanmaster is convinced that William Turner, the orphan he placed with the Godbolt family is not the same little boy he originally placed with them even though the Godbolt's say he is. There is also a dirty secret haunting Aet Visser, and Edward's involvement tracking regicides. There are several instances in this book involving violence against children that I think readers may find disturbing. Concerning the actual plot of figuring out who is snatching the orphan children and why-the description says suspects abound but the author reveals the culprit in the first half of the book so there is absolutely no suspense built up in figuring out who was responsible for these vile deeds. The reader already knows! It is the townspeople who have the long list of suspects. I think the novel would have read much better had the reader been kept in the dark as to who the killer was. When the action finally did pick up in the last 50 pages of the book and the reason why the killer did all these things was revealed there wasn't much excitement surrounding it because you already knew the person's identity. It seems like the shock value of the grisly killings was supposed to take the place of the tension building aspect you normally get in a novel surrounding a mystery/thriller. The author does add in an interesting element by having the townspeople believe that the killings are the result of Witika madness (i.e. the killer is some Indian-demon who is kidnapping and eating the orphan children). Even with this thrown in the book didn't work for me. Amidst all the violence and strange happenings, there was the romance between Blandine and Edward which I did enjoy. Overall though I found this story to be one of the most bizarre I have read in awhile. I did like Zimmerman's writing style but the disjointed narrative and really strange plot made The Orphanmaster a book that was really hard for me to get through.  *review copy from NetGalley*\",\n",

       "  'review': [\"After previously reading a couple of excellent books by this author I have been planning to read more of his work for sometime. So when I had 'The Survivor' recommended to me I decided to finally read another book by Gregg Hurwitz. The story is based in Los Angeles and features Nate Overbay who is a divorced former solider suffering from PTSD and slowly dying from ALS. He has decided to end his life and after going up to an eleventh-floor bank, climbs out of the bathroom window onto the ledge, and gets ready to end it all. But as he is preparing himself he watches a band of robbers bursting into the bank shooting employees and customers. He decides to confront the robbers and with nothing to lose overcomes them one by one but is given a warning by the last member of the gang. Nate soon learns what that message meant. He is kidnapped by Pavlo, a savage Russian mobster and mastermind of the failed heist. Unable to break back into the bank to get the critical item inside, Pavlo gives Nate an ultimatum, break in and get what he needs or watch Pavlo slowly kill the one thing Nate loves most, his ex-wife Janie and his teenage daughter Cielle, both lost when he came back from Iraq broken and confused. Now he's got one last chance to protect the people he loves, even if it's the last thing he is able to do.  This is an excellent action filled read that features some really good characters and multi levelled plots. I don't plan on leaving it so long to read another book by this author.\",\n",
       "   'An excellent beginning before a remarkable plunge into darkness and despair at the hands of a homicidal maniac in the name of family. 4 of 10 stars',\n",
       "   \"This was an other faboulas read by the master. This was a very fast paced novel of a man who was mentally scarred by war. He protected his family from the Ukranion mafia whalst suffering from the symtems of ALS more commonly known as Lou Garic's disease. It is a great novel of courage, strenth and humility. I highly recommend it to all. Enjoy and Be Blessed. Diamond\",\n",
       "   \"I was looking for a mystery/thriller that would  wow  me. I've just finished a couple in that genre that fell a little flat.  This one was  the one . From the first page, Nate looking down the side of the building, eleven stories high, ready to jump, my stomach was flipping with anxiety. I think through the course of this book I felt every emotion. Fear, heartbreak, thrill, joy, relief, anger, hopefulness... It wasn't just the story that dragged me all over the emotional map, but the writing! This guy Hurwitz has a way with words. There was beauty in the heartbreak, humor in the angst, descriptive war flashbacks where time slowed to a crawl revealing every nuance of the moment.  The character development was quite detailed, even the bad guys, but not overly so. My favorite was Nate's friend killed in the war. The embodiment of guilt and trauma.  The story itself was good too. Halfway through it seemed like it was over. What more could happen? A lot more! Twists, turns, obstacles hurled in the way. Layer upon layer of situations, moral dilemmas, problems and adversities.  I'm glad I took a chance picking this book up. Frankly I was not expecting too much, Hurwitz doesn't seem to be on very many radars, but he's on mine now and I'm already starting a second book. \",\n",
       "   \"Whenever I read action genre books, I expect to accept some things that don't quite mesh with reality. No problem. My problem with this story is the book is laced with silly and unnecessary unbelievable things. Big gun battles ending with hero about to fire the final kill shot to kill an enemy only to hear a 'click'. Twice in the same story! Really? Evil doers who seem omniscient in that they know every ATM withdrawal the hero's wife makes but can't track the hero despite the fact he carries his cell phone switched on. Enemy who is described as a massive, superhumanly strong man. Gets in tussle with hero who has been shot in shoulder of arm weakened by ALS yet hero manages to gain advantage in struggle for a weapon they both grab at once. The list goes on. Too bad. Basic plot is good, but the nonsense got tiresome. \",\n",
       "   \"Gregg Hurwitz's SURVIVOR sends me into manic-depressive swings, the turbo-charged plot producing a high so exhilarating from the very first page that meth might as well be Valium, and writing—oh, that kid's prose—that makes me weep with the knowledge that I could never be that good, that lyrical, in my dreams.  Once again, Hurwitz takes a sympathetic, ordinary guy, gives him some inner angst and throws him into an impossible, life-threatening, morality-questioning situation and lets the guy's adrenaline and inner hero take over. After that, all you can do is fasten your seat belt, hang on tight, let the G-force slam you back in your reading chair and let the music of Hurwitz's words carry you on one hell of a ride. Absolutely the best thriller I've read this year (despite Gillian Flynn's brilliance, JT Ellison's heart, Allison Brennan's gumption, etc.). Hurwitz is among a very small cadre of authors at the top of their game—amazing storytellers with an incredible ear for language and facility with words. Six out of five stars, and I'm only a quarter of the way through. \",\n",
       "   \"This is the 10th book by this author that I've read and he is consistent. All of them, so far, have been a solid 4 stars. There aren't too many authors I can say that about.  I like his stories. They have a great pace and there's lots of action. I like that the characters experience some extremely bad luck, but it is tempered with good things too. I can never guess how they are going to get out of their current predicament. I like those kinds of surprises....and there are lots of them in this book. The MC is endearing as he tries to cope with some big issues and yet he needs to save his family from destruction. Overall, I liked this one....so 4 stars.\",\n",
       "   'A down and out war veteran has come to the end of his rope when he gets thrown into the middle of completing a bank heist, attempted by a Ukrainian mob, that he foolishly thwarted. His family is at risk if he does not comply and he is given a deadline, however, what they are asking for could bring on many innocent deaths.  This book got a little slow through the middle but kept my interest and the ending was a little cliche but still held a slight mystery. Scott Brick did a good job bringing the characters to life without over exaggerating the accents. ',\n",
       "   \"Unless you have a very strong stomach, I would not recommend this book. I, myself, almost did not continue reading after the first 50 pages.  It's not a happy book in the least. The only saving grace is that in the end poor Nate gets revenge and finds a way out that is satisfactory. Much violence. But a great psycological mystery about Nate's tragic character. I'm glad I stuck with it, yet I'm glad it's done. \",\n",

       "   \"It's been awhile since I've read a Gregg Hurwitz book. To be honest, The Survivor has been on my to-read list for awhile. I'm glad I finally got around to it. This author is a master at creating anti-heroes, and Nate Overby doesn't disappoint. He's an absolutely wonderful character. I couldn't get enough of Nate.  I agree with what most the reviewers say, that this book is gripping from the very beginning and starts to slack a bit over the middle part. It was much of the same; Nate trying to secure his family's safety and being confronted with his illness.  Honestly, sometimes the story-line bordered on the improbable - For instance, why were the bad guys able to track Nate so well - and all the time? While all the law enforcement agencies were nowhere to either believe, support or help Nate and his family. I thought that was a bit far-fetched. Overall, there were elements that I absolutely liked: the normalcy of Nate's family and what he went through after coming back from the war. Also, the ending brought a lump to my throat.\",\n",
       "   \"Thriller master Gregg Hurwitz creates his most compelling protagonist yet in his latest superb novel, THE SURVIOR. Once again Hurwitz hooks the reader In the first few pages. This time by having an ALS victim's suicide attempt interrupted by a vicious bank robbery. Hurwitz ramps up the action and squeezes the tension out of every page, all the while creating a complicated character with an intriguing backstory. A great read!\",\n",
       "   'We often hear the phrase,  page turner  when describing a fast paced novel. Nowhere will you find that phrase more aptly used that right here. Beginning where a bank robbery interrupts our protagonist committing suicide, the characters are real and so likable (well except for the bad guys).  Not going to say a whole lot about this one, but it is very enjoyable and suspenseful. ',\n",
       "   'Nate Overbay is a down on his luck guy who is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after his best friend was killed in combat. He is ready to end his life after finding out he has been diagnosed with another ailment. He will be leaving his wife and daughter behind but he has pulled away from them over the years after his return from service. He is on the 11th story edge of the bank building when he hears gun shots inside the back. He peeks into the window nearest him and see six armed men taking over the bank. Before he knows it, he has entered the window and starts taking out the bank robbers. There is one man left and he leaves Nate with a warning that his life could be in danger. Nate is confronted by a Ukrainian mobster and told that he must retrieve the item they were robbing the bank for or his wife and daughter will be in danger. Nate now has to focus on keeping his family safe and not focus on his lack of will to live before it is too late. Hurwitz did not disappoint with his latest book. It started out with an action scene and never let up. I found myself knowing that things could not be so easy for Nate but I had no idea how Hurwitz would add more suspenseful twists without the story getting too unbelievable but he succeeded. Of course some of the situations seem unfathomable to the common person but it was not so over done that I rolled my eyes at absurdity.  There were moments in this book that I was on the edge of my seat and then there would be a paragraph that would have me on the edge of tears. Hurwitz had me on an emotional roller coaster throughout the book. I was rooting for Nate to repair his relationships with his wife and daughter, work through is new health diagnosis, figure out how to deal with his Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and fight back against the group of Ukrainians coming after him.  I felt that the characters were well developed. There was enough detail to keep me informed and have a clear picture in my mind but there was not so much detail that I became bored while I was reading. I also liked that the intimate scenes were not too graphic. The interactions and responses from the characters seemed realistic to me and made me want to know even more about them when I finished the book. Overall, this is another Hurwitz book that I would highly recommend. I find Hurwitz to be a refreshing author. He adds suspense but keeps things somewhat realistic throughout the book, so it keeps you hooked from the very start of the book. He is a creative author and I have not read any of his books that let me down. I look forward to more Hurwitz books in the future. (Library Book; Read Sept 2012)',\n",
       "   \"My review posted on MADreads -  http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/m... You know you're having a bad day when your suicide attempt is interrupted by a bank robbery. Just the kind of day Nate Overbay is having. He's on an 11th floor ledge - having crawled out of the window of his bank - very carefully choosing his landing spot in a dumpster (so he doesn't squash anyone) when he hears a gunshot and sees the blood splatter on the window next to him. When he realizes that a group of masked gunmen are robbing the bank, Nate is torn. He's determined to go through with his jump, but the gunmen have already killed a couple of people and they make clear they're perfectly willing to kill more, including a little girl who reminds Nate of his own daughter. What's an ex-soldier to do?  Nate does do the right thing and foil the bank robbery. But the ringleader escapes after warning Nate that  he  will make him pay in ways he can't possibly imagine. For Nate, the threat holds little weight. He was just about to kill himself after all. And if suicide doesn't get him, then his recently diagnosed Lou Gehrig's disease will. It is that diagnosis on top of the PTSD he can't shake and the finalization of his divorce that has brought Nate to this point and he is finding it surprisingly freeing to not care. Even when the  he  of the threat (Ukrainian mobster Pavlo) kidnaps him and makes clear that very bad things are going to happen, Nate is ready. What he isn't ready for is the threat to his daughter Cielle and that changes everything. Now he's got only a few days to complete the task set for him by Pavlo. If he fails it is Ciele who will pay. I've been in a reading slump lately. It's not that I haven't read any good books, I have, it's just that nothing has been ringing my bell. You know what I mean. That book that grabs you and enthralls you and leaves you wanting more. The one that is just so good you have to keep reading well past your bedtime. I know you've all read them.  Survivor  has broken my slump. Certainly this is a page-turner, but it is also a deeply moving story of a man who is struggling and remains human throughout. This is the best thriller I've read this year.\",\n",
       "   \"I have only read one of Gregg Hurwitz' books and really enjoyed it, so when I saw his new release out I promptly downloaded it onto my Kindle. Luckily for me I had a few days off work and decided this was a perfect time to settle down and make a start. However, I probably should have known better and realised very quickly that this book certainly wasn't one that would make me settle! From the very beginning the action is full on, Gregg Hurwitz put the pedal to the metal and the reader has no choice but to go along for the ride. The opener of the book (and this is not a spoiler as it is on the main synopsis on the back of the book); starts with Nate Overbay looking down eleven floors whilst contemplating his own suicide. Within seconds he hears gunshots and realises that he is witnessing a major bank heist and that people's lives are at risk other than his own. From this very first chapter the book is very high octane (LOVE those words together) and Nate decides to put other people's feelings before his own. Nate was a former military guy and his training kicks in and he makes a decision to tray and save these people. What Nate fails to realise is that the one man that got away is also the same person that will make his life hell. From this point on we see Nate try to keep his estranged family safe. The book takes some amazing turns and at times I felt worn out by Nate's attempts to keep his family safe. This book may be a slight stretch on the truth but it certainly keeps you hooked. The one element of this book that I liked was the fact that Nate was ill with a disease that I didn't know all that much about. It seemed to me by the end of it that Gregg Hurwitz did an amazing job of making this part of the story without overdoing it. I must say that by the end I not only felt worn out, but was disappointed to have finished a great book. Thankfully I have lots of his other books in my large and ever extending to read list. A definite must for fans of the action packed kinda book! \",\n",
       "   \"Nate Overbay is afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease. He's been told that he has about six months of good health before his body begins to break down. Feeling despondent, he goes to a downtown L.A. building to commit suicide. He notices that there is a robbery going on in the bank where he was planning suicide. The robbers are in a frenzy and shoot the employees if they don't act quickly enough for them. Nate is someone who likes to help others and he spots a gun on the floor. He creeps into the bank and, not caring if he's shot or not, begins shooting the robbers. He kills all but one and that man runs out but before doing so, tells Nate,  He will make you pay in ways you can't imagine.  Nate becomes an overnight hero. He has one wound and after returning from the hospital, the surviving gunman and three other men are waiting in his apartment. The leader is a man named Pavel and Nate is told that he must retrieve something in a safe deposit box at the bank or Nate's daughter will be made to suffer in ways that Nate couldn't forsee. Now he must try to find what's in the safe deposit box and find a way to stop these men while still saving his daughter from harm. This must be done as his body is becoming weaker from the ALS. Yes, this is a thriller but it also conveys strong messages to the reader, told by a number of well described and memorable characters.\",\n",
       "   \"This is my second book by Gregg Hurwitz and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. After reading,  You're Next , and loving it he does not disappoint with  The Survivor . Nate Overbay, an ordinary guy with a beautiful wife and daughter, is deployed to Afghanistan where he witnesses the death of his best friend. Upon his return he suffers with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and is then diagnosed with a terminal illness.  The book begins with Nate standing on the ledge of the 11th floor bank building where he has decided to end his life. He hears gun shots from inside and peeks in the window where he sees armed men robbing the bank, He quickly becomes a hero and kills five of the robbers unwittingly setting himself up for the revenge of a Ukranian mobster who needs an item from a safety deposit box in the vault. Nate then has five days to retrieve the item or his daughter will be killed.  The roller-coaster ride begins and doesn't end until the very last page! Gregg Hurwitz gives us such a serious story, not only with the robbery and murders, but with the attempted suicide because of a future Nate cannot face, and then adds humor in just the right places to make this an amazing read!\",\n",
       "   \"As I was reading Survivor, I decided that the writer had written this book with a movie in mind. It's that kind of non stop action story with a sympathetic hero (PTSD AND ALS)dead best friend who appears as a ghost Rescue Me style from time to time and a Ukranian mob villian who's the baddest badass, except when it comes to his 17 year old daughter. I call this an airplane book. It's very entertaining but when the story is over, its not one you are going to spend any time afterwards thinking about. Best to leave it in the pocket for the next passenger to read to kill a few hours. Turns out that Gregg Hurwitz has written for television, the movies and comics. That probably explains his style. In fact, when I read his biography I was reminded of Robert Crais. Turns out Crais has done an interview with Gregg Hurwitz.  While the characters behave fairly predictably, and the story is a wee bit formulaic, The Survivor is entertaining and a fun and thrilling read. In the end, sometimes that's just what you're looking for.\",\n",
       "   \"An ordinary man in desperate straits turns a corner to find himself in extraordinary circumstances. This was a fast-paced story with likable characters, even though I wanted to scream at the 15 year old daughter at times. There was much violence and death as a warning to those turned off by that. I was satisfied with the denouement. One question I had was regarding a key and why didn't Nate handle that differently.\",\n",
       "   \"This is the best thriller I've read in years. I've been a fan of Hurwitz, really liked Trust No One and They're Watching. They were excellent, this novel is spectacular. If you like well-drawn, complex characters, non stop action and unpredictable twists and turns do not miss The Survivor!\",\n",
       "   \"Audio Scott Brick narrator I've been critical of Brick before, but this one he hit out-of-the-park. I don't think anyone could have done better. This book consisted of two distinct parts for me. The first part, which consisted of Nate in Iraq thru Nate's incident at the bank, was so well written that it could have been a stand alone five star short story. The remainder, although entertaining, was standard suspense.\",\n",
       "   'FYI... Hurtwitz tortures the crap out of his MC in this. Fascinating read, though.',\n",
       "   'Absolutely loved this book! Nate is amazing through the whole thing. It showed two very different ways in which two men loved their daughters. Fantastic.',\n",
       "   \"THE SURVIVOR (Pub. 2012) by Gregg Hurwitz is a fantastic read. It starts off with an unexpected twisted-up bang within the first few pages, sucks you right in and keeps blazing away to the last page. This book is almost impossible to put down, and I finished it in less than two days. If you love stand-alone thrillers that pull on your emotions while biting your nails sitting on the edge of your seat, you will love Gregg Hurwitz's novels. The story is centered around Nate Overbay, a former soldier who served in the Mideast, and returns home with a rough case of PTSD, coupled with crippling guilt born from watching a good buddy die in his place. That info comes in a succinct quick-zip of backstory woven around the opening scene taking place in present time. Nate's been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) on the heels of losing his beloved wife and daughter to an impending divorce, which is the last straw for our soon-to-be hero. He heads up to the eleventh floor of a bank building, and climbs out on a ledge planning to jump. But fate has its own plans, when behind Nate's back, vicious thieves start shooting innocent bank tellers then turn their guns on a little four-yr old girl. Nate climbs back in the window and shows them what a real man is made of.  But Nate's heroic efforts quickly unleash a huge ball of trouble for him and his family because the bank heist was perpetrated by a Russian mafia head, all for the sake of breaking into a safe deposit box. The box's contents set off a whole chain of cataclysmic events. Hurwitz makes us quickly care about Nate, and cheer him on throughout the story, hoping all the while that things will end well for him. And very badly for the scarily believable villains. We get a small squirt of romance, a few chuckles along the way, a quasi murder mystery, a scoop of detective work, all woven around the absolutely thrilling main plot line. All the characters are well drawn, but the spotlight stays firmly on Nate, and I greatly admire Hurwitz's skills in pulling off that dual edged sword so well. This is the second Hurwitz novel I've read, and between the two, I'm completely impressed with this author. The writing is top-notch, the stories are multi layered with just the right amount of description and character building without once tripping up the relentless pace or deviating too far from the thriller vibe. Hurwitz has easily vaulted onto my Top 5 favorite authors list, and I'm thrilled to know there are a dozen more of his books on the shelf. I can't wait to read the next one.\",\n",
       "   \"Nate Overbay is about to jump from an 11th story building into bustling traffic when The Survivor begins. He's miserable. He's lost everything important to him and has no hope. He's dying from ALS and doesn't want to be a burden in his final month and decides suicide is the best way out. As he's contemplating the jump, he spots a robbery taking place inside the bank whose ledge he's balanced on. Innocents are dying and despite his distraught state, he can't simply stand by and watch. In a terrifying, nail-biting scene of bravery he steps in . . .   Nate's heroic actions set off a series of events that no sane person could ever envision. Now he must keep it together long enough to save his estranged wife and daughter. To give away anything else about the plot will destroy the read for you. So I won't. Just trust me this is a good one. I am in no way a “thriller” girl. I prefer sexy books, or supernatural books or flat out horrific books. Thrillers usually put me to sleep.   Not this one.   After the intense beginning I expected I'd soon find myself bored. Who can keep up that kind of momentum? This guy can. It was action packed but even better I found myself 100% invested in the characters. The author inserts flashback scenes that make you want to weep for all of them. He flashes back to the early days of young love between Nate and his wife and I start to get teary. It's hard not to because you know how it ends and why it ends and it just doesn't seem fair He flashes back to Nate's biggest regret as a soldier and I really needed some tissue. But when he reveals the reason Nate took on such a painful job (probably one of the worst jobs imaginable) it became difficult to drive with all of the tears blocking my vision and I had to save the rest of the audio for menial tasks around the house instead.   Survivor is emotional and gut-wrenching and much more than just another suspenseful thriller. If it is ever made into a movie I won't bitch and moan like I usually do if my husband wants to drag me to it. I would love to see this on the big screen.   If you're an audiobook fan grab the version read by Scott Brick. He did a fantastic job with this piece. He is serious, masculine and his voice fits the tone perfectly.\",\n",
       "   \"I have read a few books by Gregg Hurwitz and they are always a thrilling read. This one is no exception. Our protagonist is Nate Overbay, an ex-soldier, separated from his wife and child and suffering from a terminal illness. Whilst preparing to take his own life from the eleventh floor of a local bank he discovers a vicious bank raid and becomes an accidental hero. However what follows threatens to destroy Nate's life and everything he holds dear - his family. He is targeted by the big boss behind the bank raid, a psychopathic Ukranian mobster who thinks nothing of killing innocent people. Nat has to do his bidding or risk losing his family.  This was a pacy read with some violence, although not gratuitously so. Nate has had some horrors to face, particularly during his days as a soldier and these still haunt him - along with the 'ghost' of his best friend, a fellow soldier from Afghanistan, killed on one of their missions. This was the only part of the story that I found irritating and for me, the graphic descriptions of his friend's appearances throughout didn't add anything.  The characters were mainly believable and engaging, particularly Nate and his family. I did think that some of the plot involving Pavlo were a little far fetched in places but there was enough tension and twists and turns in the story to keep the reader's interest. A recommended read. My thanks to Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book. \",\n",
       "   \"I really enjoyed this book. (It made me late leaving for work twice because I just wanted to finish the chapter…) The book opens with Nate Overbay standing on a building ledge contemplating the 11-story drop to his death. Witnessing a bank robbery taking place in the building behind him, he decides to help as people are being gunned down. He steps into the bank and begins taking out the robbers without any thought to his own safety - after all, he was just going to kill himself. After his handgun clicks on an empty chamber, he comes face-to-face with the crew boss and is told that “he will make you pay.”  Nate was on the verge of jumping because his life has fallen apart. He suffers from PTSD from his time with the military in Iraq, is estranged from the love-of-his-life who he met and married in college, has a teenage daughter who hates him and has now been diagnosed with ALS. If that wasn't enough to bring him to suicide, he has now become the target of a Ukrainian mob boss, Pavlo Shevchenko, the man who hired the bank crew. Shevchenko threatens to kill Nate's daughter if he doesn't get the item that is kept in the safe deposit box at the bank and bring it to him by the end of the week. The race is on as Nate attempts to keeps his family safe from Shevchenko, retrieve the item and outwit the authorities. Rating: 4 Stars\",\n",
       "   \"Having read quite a few thrillers, I more or less understand the mechanics of most of these books. No matter what the premise is, they tend to follow the same lines: innocent man or woman ends up in a hopeless situation, all seems lost, nobody can be trusted, you know the deal. You could almost wonder why you should read these books anymore.  However, the way a book is written, characters, background and setting can turn a predictable book into something that is still exhilerating to read. Linwood Barclay is a good example of a writer who can always come up with the goods, and I will make sure to now also hunt for other books Gregg Hurwitz has written. The Survivor is the first of his books I have read and I really enjoyed it. The intrigue he has come up with is worthy of a summer blockbuster movie, but this book excels when it comes to character building and the emotional weight of many of the scenes. Often in books like these it's all about the action, with background info mainly added as an afterthought, but that is not the case here. I cared for the characters and their relationships, in addition to being thrilled by the many plot twists, and what more can you hope for in a good thriller. I would like to give it 4.5 stars, but since that is not possible I'll stick to 4.\"],\n",
