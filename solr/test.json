        "review": "This book is very important and should be read by those in ministry, especially teaching. I still think that one should read \"Our Father Abraham; Jewish Roots of the Christian Faith\" first as it lays the foundation for this and many other books like this. This book will definitely give you many things to think about and challenge the way you understand some of the things Jesus said. In particular I find that I must revisit Matthew 5:17 and study as my whole understanding of that text has been deeply and properly challenged. I find this quite exhilarating and I look forward to interacting with this text in a new way. Although I teach weekly and have now for several decades I desire to continue to learn and this is right up my alley, if you want to be stimulated to deeper study and are excited about learning and being challenged this book and this subject will do it. And yes, this book like the others in this genre comes from a high view of scripture, a position of great reverence and conservative scholarship."

        "review": "Title: Jesus the Jewish Theologian\nAuthor: Brad H. Young\nPages: 344\nYear: 1993\nPublisher: Baker Academic\nMy rating 4 out of 5 stars.\nIn searching for a deeper understanding of Yeshua, the Bible, and its Jewish flavor, I enjoyed another of the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books so I thought this one might be just as helpful in my searching. I can say that without exception it really helped me understand in new ways who Jesus was and is, the Jewish listeners of the first century and a deeper understanding of the words of scripture.\nSome of what Brad shared were new insights that broadened my view and deepened my understanding of what Jesus spoke. For me, it also helped remove some of my western thoughts to put the Bible back into its historical context as well as how the listeners would have understood what Jesus said. Of course, in some ways the author includes conjecture or assumptions as to what someone thought, but those I just read and took them as his opinion not necessarily as fact.\nWhat made the book most enjoyable was discussing it with a friend; it was fun to see what each of us thought, understood, agreed with or disagreed with, and at times what challenged our long-standing views. I love books that challenge me to think, rethink and be able to defend why I believe what I do or be willing to adopt new views based on what I am learning. One of the gifts my parents bestowed upon me was a love of learning. What Jesus bestowed on me was a love to draw nearer to Him.\nI highly recommend Brad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book for a book club, Sunday school class, small group, or just for a person to read alone. Just know that it will challenge you, excite you, ignite a fire for more understanding of the Master Jesus we follow!"

        "review": "Writing style is a bit dull and choppy, and the author is unnecessarily repetitive in some parts. However, much of the extrabiblical parallels to Jesus' teaching in Jewish literature is fascinating and casts new light upon the teachings and life setting of Jesus and his contemporaries. In fact, several of these parallels seemingly clarify some oft debated teachings of Jesus, especially his instruction on divorce and remarriage. I found the chapters on \"Controversy and Children,\" \"Divorce and Adultery in Light of the Words of Jesus,\" \"Giving Thanks- a Way of Life,\" \"Faith as Chutzpah,\" and \"The Pharisee and the Tax Collector\" to be the richest and most value-laden for my personal studies."

        "review": "is this REALLY the Supreme Doctrine? Or is it just the old Way, Truth and the Life in modern dress?\nWe've all experienced sudden onsets of fear in the middle of an otherwise normal time in our lives...\nBe it self-conscious stage fright, a sudden feeling of mental paralysis, or a distant fearsome memory - all of us have felt the iron grip of cold, icy distress from time to time for no apparent reason.\nChristians might call it an intuition of an evil outside ourselves. But isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that skirting the issue a little?\nDr. Hubert Benoit, a psychotherapist in WWII France, was inclined to call it a deep existential dread in the face of death. At least that's my take on his weighty words and theories. \nBut, before I go further, first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a look at the MAN, Hubert Benoit. \nWho exactly WAS he?\nWell, as I said, he was a learned psychiatrist - BEFORE June 6, 1944. In the raging battles that followed D-Day in the vicinity of the Allied landing, he was critically wounded in the crossfire, and was disabled. He became bedridden and was in extreme pain for a very long time afterward.\nBut Benoit had experienced breakthroughs in distress and sudden cures with his patients, real releases from turmoil and anxiety. \nHe KNEW there was a way, as Wittgenstein said, to get the \"fly - us - out of the fly-bottle - our psychological impasses,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and find true freedom.\nBy concentrating, he enhanced his awareness. \nLight became brighter, colours more vivid - and his pain more intolerable.\nBut he heard about the novel approach of Zen Buddhism to ending all our hangups. So he decided to get HIMSELF out of a life of dependence in the same way, through thought, reading and meditation. \nHe saw in people around him the patterns of fear and subsequent avoidance of reality we've described above, and had a feeling he could release HIMSELF forever from that icy spasm of nothingness - with the help of the tranquility of his forced inaction and a close psychotherapeutical attention to his own thought patterns.\nDid he succeed? \nHe says he did, though he downplays the fact. \nAfter all, he was a doctor and followed professional protocol.\nBut he presents to us the intellectual raison-d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c3\u00aatre of a satori-in-process, from a MEDICAL point of view. And I think from the sounds of that, his experiences were Real.\nTo hear him tell of it, it all begins when traumatic episodes in our lives leave a residue of muscle contraction - a seizing up, say, of our solar plexus in a sudden nameless anxiety.\nBut he says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not stuck with that problem forever if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t WANT to be.\nNot if we face it straight on, in disciplined meditation. \nIf we do that, faithfully and prayerfully, in time that icy numbness will melt away in a new feeling of lightness and freedom.\nAnd, you know, simple Faith can do the trick too! The hard, real truth of religion...\nIf we put our faith and all our thoughts in a Higher Being - and leave everything to Him as a routine habit of prayer - \nAs we relax, we will come to see that all our contractions were just our little, worried, exaggerated selves, automatically working off in some corner of our body in reaction to subconscious dread, squeezing our muscles in empty existential anxiety around an empty centre.\nWe were - quite simply - giving ourselves grief for no good reason. Banging our heads against a wall...\nAnd can you imagine being free from THAT forever? \nHe says we can.\nThis is a good (and extraordinarily difficult) book, but fascinating in its insights - remember, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re couched in psychological and medical lingo. \nAnd, as I say, as I grow older with the mature introspective certainty of advanced age, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had similar insights on my own.\nWhen I was 20, I was hospitalized and frantic attempts were made to bring my burgeoning \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbrain fever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to an abrupt halt. \nThrough extensive conditioning, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there\u00e2\u20ac\u009d signs - so to speak - were posted on the tortuous synapses of my forebrain. \nBut now, 50 years later, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve succeeded in removing most of those threatening signs from my preconscious mind, secure in the calm serenity of my faith. \nWhat have I found?\nStrange to say, more and more I see a simple, unclouded and continuously uneventful present moment stretching before my attentive awareness. \nAnd it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful.\nAnd for me, simple truth doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much more Supreme than that.\nIf love and attention can continue peacefully like this into an indeterminately long future -\nWithout angst or fear -\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty good idea that Heaven is Real.\nWouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you?\nAnd yes - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the new Supreme Doctrine is just the old Tried and True Way of Tradition!"

        "review": "Those who wish to keep their culturally independent idea of Jesus in tact should steer clear of this book. But, those who are adventurous enough to accept the real Jesus should read this book twice.\n---Update---\nI have just finished reading this excellent and challenging work for the second time (likely not the last). It is a difficult read not because of its opacity but its clarity. Having heard, I must respond; having learned, I must practice."

        "review": "This book is absolutely amazing, but extremely hard to get through. It's almost as difficult as reading Nietzsche. Benoit is explaining in \"occidental\" terms to \"occidental thinkers\" what is meant by Zen literature when it asserts that \"From the beginning nothing was\" or \"Attention, that is the whole of the teaching.\" He says that these things ARE explainable, and he does a very good job of doing so. \nSo like the Taliban think of time in decades and not minutes, hours, and days, and the American aggressors in the region have no chance of winning the war because we think with our watches and our timetables--so Eastern people think of these Taoist/Buddhist/Hindu concepts. Our Western minds need a Rosetta Stone in order to decode these elusive Eastern ideas, and to me, this book is it. \nVery dense, very rewarding. Or \"Great doubt, great effort.\""

        "review": "My reading experience of this book was optimal. I read this book because personally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a huge laker fan. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of anything that has to do with the team. When you add inside information of one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, I had to pick this book up. When I started reading this book I had high expectations after reading some of Lazenby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other pieces, and this book loved up to any expectation I had. A personal connection I had to this book is the front cover. My father Michael Stewart is pictured trying to block Kobe on the cover of this book. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of my favorite pictures of my dad from when he played in the league. A constant theme I saw in this book was work ethic, it is simply amazing how much work this man put in to become great. Lazenby says that Kobe never went out and partied with the team or did anything of that nature, he stayed to himself and worked on his craft. This is why Kobe struggled with team chemistry early on. I think Lazenby made this a theme of the book because at the time people didnt really know how much work Kobe really put in. I recommend this book to any sports fan especially Laker fanatics like myself."
