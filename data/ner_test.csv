0,zero,"This took me approximately a million years to listen to the audiobook, but that's not the book's fault that's just me being lazy. But this was such an interesting and layered fantasy story. It dealt with grief and trauma very well, in a way I'd never seen before. The world that was built up totally captivated me. Despite taking me a long time to read, I think that the pacing did seem consistent as there was pretty much constant action, even in moments of inaction. The start of a super cool series I think!"
1,one,"the best book i've read in a really long time. 2020 was sort of a fail on all fronts for me, so finding such a good book so early in 2021 feels like a good omen.

PICK THIS UP!"
2,zero,"Wow, I did not expect this to be so intense and deep. This is such a robust and gripping modern day fantasy tale. So thoroughly entertaining. This author deserves a lot of acclaim for the complex and intricate world building alone. The unconventional perspective on fantasy was so refreshing.
I was honestly shaken multiple times through the book due to the plot twists and bombshells, which kept me riveted.
Can see this easily becoming a new favorite among fantasy lovers."
3,zero,"DNF at Colonizer magic, this was after the constant mention of I am black and everything/everyone is racist even though I judge everyone based on their looks and yeah I am crushing on this basic white boy after 2 days and just never mind that my personality is extremely annoying . My first near DNF was the info dump chapter which makes it impossible to understand what the hell is happening after that. But I have a feeling it don't matter to must they want the woke points and will like this book. I tried I really tried its terrible."
4,one,Did not finish. Couldn‚Äôt get past the cliche of throwing police brutality in there when she was an underage drinker and there was no mention of force being used. 
5,zero,"I did not finish this book. The writing was drawn out. The development of the world was choppy and confusing. Because of the confusion, it was hard to understand exactly what was going on. The book has potential but as a YA novel, the cumbersome task of trying to keep up with so many new and unfamiliar terms while adjusting to and deciphering the new world takes away pleasure in enjoying the story."
6,one,this book really spoke to my soul
7,two,this book. oh my God this book. i‚Äôm really overwhelmed with emotion and like reeling from that last 100 pages and i‚Äôll gather my thoughts later but truly i love love loved this. 
8,zero,"I really thought I was going to love this book more than I did, but unfortunately it was a little bit of a disappointment for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I still enjoyed it, but I was predicting a 5 star read!

The things I loved about this book was the characters, such as Bree (main character), as I really enjoyed how she dealt with her grief and how strong she was, as a character. I also really liked the romance! This book has a love triangle, which I usually don‚Äôt love that much, but I actually quite like how it was done in this. I don‚Äôt even know which pairing I prefer! I also really liked how racism and Slavery was discussed in the book, I think the way it was integrated into the story was great! The ending of the book was also another thing I loved, as I didn‚Äôt see the twist coming!

However, my main issue with this book was how hard it was for me to understand the Legendborn world. There were a lot of terms used and I found it hard to follow and it made me lose interest in the book. By the end of the book, I feel like I understand most of it but I still feel a bit confused. I think a glossary would have benefited this book a lot, or it definitely would have benefited me at least!

Overall, I enjoyed it and will most likely read the sequel. As I definitely want to know more after that ending! "
9,two,"I know that this is a very unpopular opinion as I saw and read so many 4 stars and 5 stars reviews. I wanted to like this book so much, but I just could not get into the story. This book has great potential and I understand why it is so popular, but sadly it was not for me.

The basic storyline of the book is quite easy to follow, but the Legendborn world? Not that easy‚Ä¶
Bree‚Äôs mother died three months ago. Now, Bree just left her home to start fresh at the University of North Carolina. There, she sees magic and realizes that it is in fact the second time that someone used magic to erase her memory (but it did not work, and no one can explain why). The first time was the night her mother died. Determined to find out what really happened to her mother, Bree decides to try to join the Legendborns, a secret group dedicated to eliminating the Shadowborns (demons) with their magic (called aether), so she can find out what happened the night her mother died.

Bree got used to the fact that demons can access her world through gates fast and easily. She also learned specific vocabulary quickly. Honestly, I got lost during the explications a few times, there seemed to be so many different factions to the Legendborn (or should I say different Chapters with a very strict hierarchy: Legendborn, Vassals, Page, Scion, chosen squire, Mage, etc.). I could not get a clear picture of this secret organization. The members talk about ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Code of Secrecy‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Order Law‚Äô‚Äô, but do not give any more details about it. I do not mind a complex magic system and the one in this book is actually really interesting, but there were whole pages of info-dumping.

It has a Mortal Instrument vibe, but in this book, the Legendborns need to worry about their everyday life. They are not invisible beings that spend their whole days killing demons. They need to go to school and keep up the appearance of normal life at any cost. I liked this part, it made everything much more relatable. What bothered me was how well Bree adapts to her new reality, she even says how she has an advantage over the other Pages because she saw someone use aether before and she saw demons twice before entering the secret society. It feels as if everything falls right into place for her. She is a 16 years old teenager and she managed to infiltrate the Legendborn society even though she knows nothing about them, more than that, people just tell her inside information because she asks them. She manages to fight a demon when almost everyone else gets injured‚Ä¶ I like that she is fierce, but it didn‚Äôt feel right how everything was going so well for her after 72 hours of being thrust into this new world.

Bree is a great main character; she has spunk and is not afraid to speak her mind. It is also nice that she is a black character, I have (sadly) not read a lot of books with a black main character and it was nice to discover this story with a slightly different perspective than what I am used to. It was interesting to discover her inner thoughts and to see how she deals with racist comments and assumptions or how her perspective is affected by the history of segregation in the United States. Nick is the golden boy sidekick who lives near the campus and decides to help Bree even though he rejected his Legendborn legacy many years ago. He is a nice character, but nothing special. Then there is Selwyn, he is intriguing, and I think that I would have liked him.

Overall, I know that this is a great book for many people, but it was not one for me. It was hard for me to get into this story because of all the info-dumping. I must mention though that the writing is gorgeous, and I really enjoyed the author's style."
10,three,"I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH.

THE FREAKING COVER, THE AWESOME CHARACTERS ARE MY LIFELINE

AND SEL MY DEAR SEL WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAINüò≠üíñ"
11,four,"This book was awesome! I had high expectations going in and it ended up delivering üòÅ

‚úÖ THE REPRESENTATION was really well done. I think this book did a good job of showing the subtle (and not so subtle) influences of racism in everyday life for Bree. It's sad that Bree and other people in the US have to put up with these types of situations and it's great to have a book in the YA Fantasy genre finally touching on this topic

‚úÖ THERE WERE LOTS OF STRONG female characters as well, so I felt like the book had a feminist vibe without being too over the top and obvious about it

‚ùå THERE WAS TOO MUCH backstory and the world was a little too complicated for the first book in a series. Gabriela and I were sending messages back and forth like ü•¥üòµü§î trying to figure out what the hierarchy of the world was haha

üÜó THE ROMANCE WAS okay but Nick just isn't my type lol. I'm personally hoping that Sel and Bree are endgame - I've been secretly rooting for them since their first interaction in the woods because I'm just a sucker for the edgy bad boy with a tortured past trope lol

‚úÖ THE TWISTS! THE PLOT! It was sooo good! There were a lot of reveals in the second half of the book that surprised me and I really enjoyed being a part of the rollercoaster ride of emotions!

Overall, I'm really happy with this book and I can't wait to read the next one! Even though the world was a little confusing (which is mostly why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5), eventually it made sense by the end. I recommend this to anyone looking for a YA urban fantasy with strong female characters, minority representation, and a really fast paced plot"
12,zero,"was very excited for this book but i ended up being quite disappointed and it took me months to get through this. the concept was interesting and i liked bree. however pacing was so slow also there wasn‚Äôt much world building information was just thrown at you constantly i feel like this book would have benefited with a glossary, family tries maps etc.

my main issue was i went into this expecting the fantasy to be revolving around black people and maybe that‚Äôs my fault. yes bree‚Äôs ancestor played a role in the legends but this was ultimately about her trying to fit herself into the order a purely white society who had a history of racism and i just wanted more for her. bree didn‚Äôt have a single black friend and her two love interests were both white i understand with this being set in north carolina there will be racism but i guess when people promote this a black fantasy i was just expecting more black people.

i did love seeing the heroine being a young black girl but it was just such a let down that most of the fantasy/ legends and storytelling revolved around the white people. this got annoying because bree has a connection to rootcraft through her black ancestors and i would have loved spending more time watching her connect to them and finding a community amongst them. i don‚Äôt know if i will give the second book a try im hoping that bree will spend more time focused on rootcrafters and finds a community within them so she doesn‚Äôt feel like such an outcast.

just wanna add that i LOVED breenick but the ending kind of ruined it for me when we found out that nicks ancestors owed bree‚Äôs ancestors as slaves like i really don‚Äôt understand why that needed to be a thing "
13,zero,"Where should I even begin?!? Listen, I‚Äôm quite familiar with the legend of King Arthur but never in my life have I seen it done in this way. There is so much to unpack in this novel. The character development, the plot development, the spectacular writing, the university history woven into every single page, the connections I felt to the Black history discussed. Everything was done in such a fast paced and interesting manner that gave me such a connection to the story as a whole.

While this is being compared to the Mortal Instruments, I find that this novel is capable of standing on its own. There is a complexity and rich history that I found in this book that I didn‚Äôt necessarily find in TMI. The world building is intense and I‚Äôm a stickler for good world building. Deonn is careful in crafting a complex world while still explaining certain nuances without revealing too much to the reader. She even took the time to include pronunciation guides within the heart of the text (I loved this!). In each and every chapter there was another layer pulled away revealing so much about the world and about Bree. There is this discussion about fantastical worlds and abilities through the lens of Black and a White people and that even in these settings, Black individuals were forced to hide their abilities for fear of persecution. There‚Äôs a dichotomy of this world that Bree must attempt to navigate which in my opinion speaks to how Black people must function in predominately White arenas even if it is just a fantasy. This is especially true to those of us that attend PWIs instead of HBCUs. Trying to navigate those experiences can be challenging. We definitely see this conflict exhibited in Bree and some of the challenges she faces when she attempts to work with the Legendborn.

Speaking of Bree, I loved her. I connected with her. I felt for her. All of this happens while she still is attempting to process her mother‚Äôs death. And while a lot of this is an exploration of attempting to figure out what happened to her mother, a great portion of this is an examination of grief. I, myself, have not felt the pain of losing a parent but Deonn made me empathetic to Bree and her journey. There is so much to be said about the conversations regarding mental health and how Bree does and does not process her trauma. There‚Äôs a lot to be said about the Black communities treatment of mental health. Honestly, as I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm still amazed at how seamlessly Deonn was able to weave in so many different aspects into just the character development. There are other main and side characters that are super diverse in race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexuality. I loved and I mean loved that it was so casual. It wasn‚Äôt added for the sake of adding it. It was representative of the norm. It didn‚Äôt move the plot. It didn‚Äôt change anything. Deonn was simply allowing her characters to be themselves. It was brilliant.

Hands down this is one of the best fantasies of 2020. And I mean truly one of the best. I‚Äôm honestly still trying to gather my thoughts but my goodness this book was pure brilliance with amazing writing, a fast plot, and such fun characters. I learned so much about root magic and it‚Äôs connection to our ancestors. I mean I just learned a heck of a lot and I love when books do that. And just wait for the twist and turns. Haha. Expect nothing. Don‚Äôt think you know anything. If you haven‚Äôt checked out this book please please please make sure you give it a try!"
14,zero,"tw: death of a parent; generational trauma (depictions of slavery, abuse, rape); gore; possession; demons; racism and micro-aggressions

This was one of the most outstanding debuts I have ever read. I went into this book fairly blind but knowing it was getting some hype, and that is well worth it. Even during a reading slump, I was able to experience the majesty of this story. Deonn combines fantasy elements that I never would have considered going together masterfully, while also weaving those fantasy elements in with the very real issues of grief, racism, oppression, and heritage. There are so many lines in here that are a punch to the chest. What initially seems like it could be more of a cookie-cutter YA story ends up being so much more.

Initially, some of the romance elements I wasn't sure about, but as the story progressed (and with elements at play revealed in the ending), I'm invested.

I cannot wait for the rest of the very promising series."
