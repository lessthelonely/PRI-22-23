NovelIdeas is a search engine directed at books, using data from a Goodreads data set - it allows filtering of many attributes and has gone through indexing for maximum efficiency. The engine includes a graphical user interface, made from Vue.js and a Python-fueled backend using FastAPI, to create book pages and everything needed to use the app.
